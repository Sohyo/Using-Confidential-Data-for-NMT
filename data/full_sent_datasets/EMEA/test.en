Adenuric is a medicine containing the active substance febuxostat .
It is available as yellow , capsule- shaped tablets ( 80 and 120 mg ) .
Adenuric is used to treat chronic ( long-term ) hyperuricaemia ( high levels of uric acid or urate in the blood ) .
Hyperuricaemia can lead to urate crystals forming and building up in the joints and the kidneys .
When this happens in the joints and causes pain , it is known as gout .
Adenuric is used in patients who already have signs of a build-up of crystals , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or tophi ( stones , larger deposits of urate crystals that can cause joint and bone damage ) .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
The recommended dose of Adenuric is 80 mg once a day .
It can be taken with or without food .
Adenuric usually reduces blood uric acid levels within two weeks , but the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day if blood uric acid levels remain above 6 mg per decilitre after two to four weeks .
Attacks of gout can still occur during the first few months of treatment , so it is recommended that patients take other medicines to prevent attacks of gout for at least the first six months of treatment with Adenuric .
Adenuric treatment should not be stopped if an attack happens .
The safety and effectiveness of Adenuric have not been studied in patients with severe kidney or liver problems .
It is not recommended for use in children or in patients who have had an organ transplant because it has not been studied in these groups .
The active substance in Adenuric , feboxustat , reduces the formation of uric acid .
It works by blocking an enzyme called xanthine oxidase , which is needed to make uric acid in the body .
By reducing the production of uric acid , Adenuric can reduce levels of uric acid in the blood and keep them low , stopping crystals from building up .

How has Adenuric been studied ?
The effects of Adenuric were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
The effectiveness of Adenuric has been studied in two main studies involving a total of 1,834 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout .
The first study , carried out in 1,072 patients , compared the effectiveness of three doses of Adenuric ( 80 , 120 and 240 mg once a day ) with that of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) and of allopurinol ( another medicine used to treat hyperuricaemia ) .
The second study compared two doses of Adenuric ( 80 and 120 mg once a day ) with allopurinol over one year in 762 patients .
In both studies , allopurinol was used at a dose of 300 mg once a day , except for patients with kidney problems , who took 100 mg .
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose final three blood uric acid levels were below 6 mg/ dl .
Blood uric acid levels were measured every month .
What benefit has Adenuric shown during the studies ?
Adenuric was more effective than allopurinol and placebo in reducing blood uric acid levels .
In the first study , 48 % of the patients taking 80 mg Adenuric once a day ( 126 out of 262 ) and 65 % of the patients taking 120 mg once a day ( 175 out of 269 ) had levels of uric acid below 6 mg/ dl in the final three measurements .
This was compared with 22 % of the patients taking allopurinol ( 60 out of 268 ) and none of the 134 patients taking placebo .
Similar results were seen in the second study after a year .
The most common side effects with Adenuric ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are headache , diarrhoea , nausea ( feeling sick ) , rash and abnormal liver test results .
There may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels , particularly in patients with a history of heart problems .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Adenuric , see the Package Leaflet .
Adenuric should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to feboxustat or any of the other ingredients .
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that Adenuric was more effective than allopurinol at lowering blood uric acid levels , but that it could carry a greater risk of side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
Der Ausschuss gelangte zu dem Schluss , dass die Vorteile von Adenuric bei der Behandlung der chronischen Hyperurikämie , wenn bereits Uratablagerungen auftraten , gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen , und empfahl , die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von Adenuric zu erteilen . The Committee recommended that Adenuric be given marketing authorisation .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Adenuric on 21 April 2008.

ADROVANCE is a white capsule-shaped tablet containing two active substances : alendronate sodium trihydrate ( 70 mg ) and colecalciferol ( vitamin D3 , 70 micrograms equivalent to 2,800 international units ) .
This medicine is the same as FOSAVANCE , which is already authorised in the European Union .
The company that makes FOSAVANCE has agreed that its scientific data can be used for ADROVANCE .
ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis ( a disease that makes bones fragile ) in post-menopausal women at risk of low vitamin D levels .
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral ( spine ) and hip fractures ( breaks ) .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
The recommended dose is one tablet once a week .
The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( not mineral water ) , at least 30 minutes before any food , drink , or other medicines ( including antacids , calcium supplements and vitamins ) .
To avoid irritation of the oesophagus ( gullet ) , the patient should not lie down until after their first food of the day , which should be at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
The tablet should not be chewed or allowed to dissolve in the mouth .
Patients should also take calcium supplements if they are not getting enough calcium from their diet .
For more information , see the Package Leaflet .
Bone is a living tissue that is constantly renewed by a process that erodes old bone and replaces it with new bone at the same rate .
Osteoporose ist eine Krankheit , bei der die Knochen allmählich dünn und brüchig werden ; es kommt zu einer erhöhten Anfälligkeit für Frakturen ( Brüche ) . It happens when not enough new bone grows to replace the bone that is naturally broken down .
Dies tritt dann ein , wenn nicht genug neues Knochengewebe nachwächst , um die natürlich abgebaute Knochensubstanz zu ersetzen . The active substances in ADROVANCE are alendronate and vitamin D3 .
Osteoporose tritt vor allem bei postmenopausalen Frauen ( nach der 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel. 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .
( 44-20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44-20 ) 74 18 84 16 E-mail : mail@emea . europa . eu http : / /www . emea . europa . eu ©EMEA 2007 Reproduction and/ or distribution of this document is authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged Vitamin D3 is a nutrient that is found in some foods , but is also made in the skin through exposure to natural sunlight .
Vitamin D3 , along with other forms of vitamin D , is required for calcium absorption and normal bone formation .
Since patients with osteoporosis may not get enough vitamin D3 through exposure to sunlight , it is included in ADROVANCE .
Because alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in authorised medicines in the European Union , the company presented data obtained in earlier studies and from the published literature .
The company also carried out a study in 35 men and 682 post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to show ADROVANCE s effectiveness in increasing vitamin D levels .
Patients received either ADROVANCE or alendronate only once a week .
The main measure of effectiveness was the percentage of patients with low vitamin D levels .
What benefit has ADROVANCE shown during the studies ?
After 15 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower among the patients treated with ADROVANCE ( 11 % ) than those taking alendronate only ( 32 % ) .
The company also presented evidence that the dose of alendronate included in ADROVANCE was the same as the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
The most common side effects ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are headache , musculoskeletal ( bone , muscle or joint ) pain and gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal ( tummy ) pain , dyspepsia ( indigestion ) , constipation , diarrhoea , flatulence ( wind ) , oesophageal ( gullet ) ulcers , dysphagia ( difficulty swallowing ) , abdominal distension ( swollen tummy ) and acid regurgitation .
For the full list of all side effects reported with ADROVANCE , see the Package Leaflet .
ADROVANCE should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to alendronate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients .
It should not be used where there are abnormalities of the oesophagus ( gullet ) , in patients who have hypocalcaemia ( low calcium levels ) , or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel ( CHMP ) entschied , dass die Vorteile von ADROVANCE bei der Behandlung von Osteoporose bei postmenopausalen Patientinnen mit Risiko eines Vitamin-D- Mangels gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen , und empfahl , die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von ADROVANCE zu erteilen . The Committee recommended that ADROVANCE be given marketing authorisation .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for ADROVANCE to Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. on 4 January 2007.
The full EPAR for ADROVANCE is available here .
Each tablet contains 70 mg alendronic acid as alendronate sodium trihydrate , and 70 micrograms ( 2800 IU ) colecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) .
Each tablet contains 62 mg lactose anhydrous and 8 mg sucrose .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Capsule-shaped , white to off-white tablets , marked with an outline of a bone image on one side , and '710 ' on the other .
Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients at risk of vitamin D insufficiency .
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures .
The recommended dosage is one ADROVANCE tablet once weekly .
Due to the nature of the disease process in osteoporosis , ADROVANCE is intended for long-term use .
To permit adequate absorption of alendronate :
ADROVANCE must be taken with water only ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage , or medicinal product ( including antacids , calcium supplements and vitamins ) of the day .
Other beverages ( including mineral water ) , food and some medicinal products are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate ( see section 4.5 ) .
The following instructions should be followed exactly in order to minimize the risk of oesophageal irritation and related adverse reactions ( see section 4.4 ) :
ADROVANCE should only be swallowed after getting up for the day with a full glass of water ( not less than 200ml or 7fl . oz . ) .
2 Die Patienten sollen sich nach Einnahme von ADROVANCE mindestens 30 Minuten nicht hinlegen . ADROVANCE soll nicht vor dem Schlafengehen oder vor dem ersten Aufstehen des Tages eingenommen werden . 2 ADROVANCE should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day .
Patients should receive supplemental calcium if intake from diet is inadequate ( see section 4.4 ) .
Additional supplementation with vitamin D should be considered on an individual basis taking into account any vitamin D intake from vitamins and dietary supplements .
The equivalence of intake of 2800 IU of vitamin D3 weekly in ADROVANCE to daily dosing of vitamin D 400 IU has not been studied .
In clinical studies there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profiles of alendronate .
Therefore no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with a glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) greater than 35ml/ min .
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment where GFR is less than 35ml/ min , due to lack of experience .
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and therefore should not be given to them .
Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
Alendronate Alendronate can cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa .
Because there is a potential for worsening of the underlying disease , caution should be used when alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems , such as dysphagia , oesophageal disease , gastritis , duodenitis , ulcers , or with a recent history ( within the previous year ) of major gastrointestinal disease such as peptic ulcer , or active gastrointestinal bleeding , or surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty ( see section 4.3 ) .
Oesophageal reactions ( sometimes severe and requiring hospitalisation ) , such as oesophagitis , oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions , rarely followed by oesophageal stricture , have been reported in patients receiving alendronate .
Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signalling a possible oesophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia , pain on swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn ( see section 4.8 ) .
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be greater in patients who fail to take alendronate properly and/ or who continue to take alendronate after developing symptoms suggestive of oesophageal irritation .
It is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to , and are understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase their risk of oesophageal problems .
3 While no increased risk was observed in extensive clinical trials with alendronate , there have been rare ( post-marketing ) reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers , some of which were severe and with complications ( see section 4.8 ) .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw , generally associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection ( including osteomyelitis ) has been reported in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment regimens including primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates .
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in patients with osteoporosis receiving oral bisphosphonates .
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors ( e. g. cancer , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , corticosteroids , poor oral hygiene , periodontal disease ) .
While on treatment , these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible .
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy , dental surgery may exacerbate the condition .
For patients requiring dental procedures , there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw .
Clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment .
Bone , joint , and/ or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates .
In post-marketing experience , these symptoms have rarely been severe and/ or incapacitating ( see section 4.8 ) .
The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment .
Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment .
A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same medicinal product or another bisphosphonate .
Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of ADROVANCE they should take one tablet on the morning after they remember .
They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week , as originally scheduled on their chosen day .
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment where GFR is less than 35ml/ min ( see section 4.2 ) .
Causes of osteoporosis other than oestrogen deficiency and ageing should be considered .
Hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with ADROVANCE ( see section 4.3 ) .
Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism ) should also be effectively treated before starting ADROVANCE .
The content of vitamin D in ADROVANCE is not suitable for correction of vitamin D deficiency .
In patients with these conditions , serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored during therapy with ADROVANCE .
Due to the positive effects of alendronate in increasing bone mineral , decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur .
However , there have been rare reports of symptomatic hypocalcaemia , which have occasionally been severe and often occurred in patients with predisposing conditions ( e. g. hypoparathyroidism , vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the magnitude of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with disease associated with unregulated overproduction of calcitriol ( e. g. leukaemia , lymphoma , sarcoidosis ) .
Urine and serum calcium should be monitored in these patients .
Patients with malabsorption may not adequately absorb vitamin D3 .
4 Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance , galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency , glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Alendronate If taken at the same time , it is likely that food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , antacids , and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate .
Therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
No other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products are anticipated .
A number of patients in the clinical trials received oestrogen ( intravaginal , transdermal , or oral ) while taking alendronate .
No adverse reactions attributable to their concomitant use were identified .
Although specific interaction studies were not performed , in clinical studies alendronate was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed medicinal products without evidence of interactions of clinical relevance .
Colecalciferol Olestra , mineral oils , orlistat , and bile acid sequestrants ( e. g. cholestyramine , colestipol ) may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants , cimetidine and thiazides may increase the catabolism of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplements may be considered on an individual basis .
ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and therefore it should not be used during pregnancy or in breast-feeding women .
There are no adequate data from the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women .
Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy , embryonal/ foetal development , or postnatal development .
Alendronate given during pregnancy in rats caused dystocia related to hypocalcaemia ( see section 5.3 ) .
Studies in animals have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity with high doses of vitamin D ( see section 5.3 ) .
It is not known whether alendronate is excreted into human breast milk .
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , there is no information to indicate that ADROVANCE affects a patient s ability to drive or operate machines .
The following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies and/ or post-marketing use with alendronate .
No additional adverse reactions have been identified for ADROVANCE .
[ Common ( 1/ 100 , < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1000 , < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 , < 1/ 1000 ) , very rare ( < 1/ 10,000 ) ]
Rare : uveitis , scleritis , episcleritis Common : abdominal pain , dyspepsia , constipation , diarrhoea , flatulence , oesophageal ulcer* , dysphagia* , abdominal distension , acid regurgitation Uncommon : nausea , vomiting , gastritis , oesophagitis* , oesophageal erosions* , melena Rare : oesophageal stricture* , oropharyngeal ulceration* , upper gastrointestinal PUBs ( perforation , ulcers , bleeding)(see section 4.4 ) . *See sections 4.2 and 4.4
Uncommon : rash , pruritus , erythema Rare : rash with photosensitivity Very rare : severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders :
Metabolism and nutrition disorders :
Common : musculoskeletal ( bone , muscle or joint ) pain Rare : severe musculoskeletal ( bone , muscle or joint ) pain ( see section 4.4 ) Rare : symptomatic hypocalcaemia , often in association with predisposing conditions .
( see section 4.4 ) Rare : transient symptoms as in an acute-phase response ( myalgia , malaise and rarely , fever ) , typically in association with initiation of treatment .
During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported ( frequency not known ) :
Osteonekrose des Kiefers wurde bei Patienten unter Bisphosphonaten berichtet ; die meisten Berichte stammen von Krebspatienten , jedoch wurde auch bei Osteoporosepatienten darüber berichtet . The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients , but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including osteomyelitis ) .
Diagnosis of cancer , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors ( see section 4.4 ) ; joint swelling .
Laboratory test findings In clinical studies , asymptomatic , mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18 % and 10 % , respectively , of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/ day versus approximately 12 % and 3 % of those taking placebo .
However , the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to < 8.0 mg/ dl ( 2.0 mmol/ l ) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl ( 0.65 mmol/ l ) were similar in both treatment groups .
Alendronate Hypocalcaemia , hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions , such as upset stomach , heartburn , oesophagitis , gastritis , or ulcer , may result from oral overdose .
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with alendronate .
In case of overdose with ADROVANCE , milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate .
Owing to the risk of oesophageal irritation , vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright .
Colecalciferol Vitamin D toxicity has not been documented during chronic therapy in generally healthy adults at a dose less than 10,000 IU/ day .
In a clinical study of healthy adults a 4000 IU daily dose of vitamin D3 for up to five months was not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia .
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet containing the two active substances alendronate sodium trihydrate and colecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) .
Alendronate Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation .
Preclinical studies have shown preferential localisation of alendronate to sites of active resorption .
Activity of osteoclasts is inhibited , but recruitment or attachment of osteoclasts is not affected .
The bone formed during treatment with alendronate is of normal quality .
Colecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 by ultraviolet light .
In the absence of adequate sunlight exposure , vitamin D3 is an essential dietary nutrient .
Vitamin D3 is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver , and stored until needed .
Conversion to the active calcium-mobilizing hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( calcitriol ) in the kidney is tightly regulated .
The principal action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphate as well as regulate serum calcium , renal calcium and phosphate excretion , bone formation and bone resorption .
Vitamin D3 is required for normal bone formation .
Vitamin D insufficiency develops when both sunlight exposure and dietary intake are inadequate .
Insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance , bone loss , and increased risk of skeletal fracture .
In severe cases , deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism , hypophosphataemia , proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia , further increasing the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals .
Supplemental vitamin D reduces these risks and their consequences .
Osteoporosis is defined as bone mineral density ( BMD ) of the spine or hip 2.5 standard deviations ( SD ) below the mean value of a normal young population or as a previous fragility fracture , irrespective of BMD .
ADROVANCE studies The effect of ADROVANCE ( alendronate 70 mg/ vitamin D3 2800 IU ) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week , multinational study that enrolled 682 osteoporotic post-menopausal women ( serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at baseline : mean , 56 nmol/ l [ 22.3 ng/ ml ] ; range , 22.5- 225 nmol/ l [ 9-90 ng/ ml ] ) .
Patients received the lower strength ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) of ADROVANCE ( n=350 ) or FOSAMAX ( alendronate ) 70 mg ( n=332 ) once a week ; additional vitamin D supplements
Nach 15-wöchiger Behandlung waren die mittleren Serumspiegel von 25-Hydroxyvitamin D signifikant höher ( 26 % ) in der Gruppe unter ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/2.800 I.E. ) ( 56 nmol/l [ 23 ng/ml ] ) als in der Gruppe unter Alendronat allein ( 46 nmol/l [ 18,2 ng/ml ] ) . After 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) group ( 56 nmol/ l [ 23 ng/ ml ] ) than in the alendronate-only group ( 46 nmol/ l [ 18.2 ng/ ml ] ) .
The percentage of patients with vitamin D insufficiency ( serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 37.5 nmol/ l [ < 15 ng/ ml ] ) was significantly reduced by 62.5 % with ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) vs. alendronate-only ( 12 % vs.
32 % , respectively ) , through week 15.
The percentage of patients with vitamin D deficiency ( serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 22.5 nmol/ l [ < 9 ng/ ml ] ) was significantly reduced by 92 % with ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) vs. alendronate-only ( 1 % vs 13 % , respectively ) .
In this study , mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with vitamin D insufficiency at baseline ( 25- hydroxyvitamin D , 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l [ 9 to < 15 ng/ ml ] ) increased from 30 nmol/ l ( 12.1 ng/ ml ) to 40 nmol/ l ( 15.9 ng/ ml ) at week 15 in the ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) group ( n=75 ) and decreased from 30 nmol/ l ( 12.0 ng/ ml ) at baseline to 26 nmol/ l ( 10.4 ng/ ml ) at week 15 in the alendronate-only group ( n=70 ) .
There were no differences in mean serum calcium , phosphate , or 24-hour urine calcium between treatment groups .
Alendronate studies The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once weekly 70 mg ( n=519 ) and alendronate 10 mg daily ( n=370 ) was demonstrated in a one-year multicentre study of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis .
The mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1 % ( 95 % CI :
4.8 , 5.4 % ) in the 70 mg once-weekly group and 5.4 % ( 95 % CI :
5.0 , 5.8 % ) in the 10 mg daily group .
The mean BMD increases were 2.3 % and 2.9 % at the femoral neck and 2.9 % and 3.1 % at the total hip in the 70 mg once weekly and 10 mg daily groups , respectively .
The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites .
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were examined in two initial efficacy studies of identical design ( n=994 ) as well as in the Fracture Intervention Trial ( FIT : n=6,459 ) .
In the initial efficacy studies , the mean BMD increases with alendronate 10 mg/ day relative to placebo at three years were 8.8 % , 5.9 % and 7.8 % at the spine , femoral neck and trochanter , respectively .
Total body BMD also increased significantly .
There was a 48 % reduction ( alendronate 3.2 % vs placebo 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo .
In the two-year extension of these studies BMD at the spine and trochanter continued to increase and BMD at the femoral neck and total body were maintained .
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies using alendronate daily ( 5 mg daily for two years and 10 mg daily for either one or two additional years ) :
FIT 1 : eine Drei-Jahres-Studie an 2.027 Patientinnen mit mindestens einer vorbestehenden Wirbel-(Kompressions-)Fraktur . A three-year study of 2,027 patients who had at least one baseline vertebral ( compression ) fracture .
In this study alendronate daily reduced the incidence of 1 new vertebral fracture by 47 % ( alendronate 7.9 % vs. placebo 15.0 % ) .
Zusätzlich wurde eine signifikante Reduktion der Inzidenz von Hüftfrakturen ( 1,1 % gegenüber 2,2 % ; Reduktion um 51 % ) festgestellt . 2.2 % , a reduction of 51 % ) .
FIT 2 : eine Vier-Jahres-Studie an 4.432 Patientinnen mit einer niedrigen Knochenmasse , aber ohne vorbestehende Wirbelfraktur . A four-year study of 4,432 patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture .
In dieser Studie wurde in der Analyse der Subgruppe mit osteoporotischen Frauen ( 37 % der Gesamtzahl , die nach der o. g. Definition an Osteoporose litten ) ein signifikanter Unterschied in der Inzidenz von Hüftfrakturen ( Alendronat 1,0 % gegenüber Plazebo 2,2 % ; Reduktion um 56 % ) und in der Inzidenz von mindestens einer Wirbelfraktur ( 2,9 % gegenüber 5,8 % ; Reduktion um 50 % ) beobachtet . 5.8 % , a reduction of 50 % ) .
Absorption Relative to an intravenous reference dose , the oral mean bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardised breakfast .
Bioavailability was decreased similarly to an estimated 0.46 % and 0.39 % when alendronate was administered one hour or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
In osteoporosis studies , alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before the first food or beverage of the day .
The alendronate component in the ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) combination tablet is bioequivalent to the alendronate 70 mg tablet .
Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with , or up to two hours after , a standardised breakfast .
Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60 % .
In healthy subjects , oral prednisone ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate ( a mean increase ranging from 20 % to 44 % ) .
Distribution Studies in rats show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/ kg intravenous administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine .
The mean steady-state volume of distribution , exclusive of bone , is at least 28 litres in humans .
Concentrations of alendronate in plasma following therapeutic oral doses are too low for analytical detection ( < 5 ng/ ml ) .
Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 % .
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans .
Elimination Following a single intravenous dose of [ 14C]alendronate , approximately 50 % of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces .
Following a single 10 mg intravenous dose , the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min , and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min .
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95 % within six hours following intravenous administration .
The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed ten years , reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton .
Alendronate is not excreted through the acidic or basic transport systems of the kidney in rats , and thus it is not anticipated to interfere with the excretion of other medicinal products by those systems in humans .
Absorption In healthy adult subjects ( males and females ) , following administration of ADROVANCE after an overnight fast and two hours before a meal , the mean area under the serum-concentration-time curve ( AUC0-120 hrs ) for vitamin D3 ( unadjusted for endogenous vitamin D3 levels ) was 296.4 ng hr/ ml .
The mean maximal serum concentration ( Cmax ) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng/ ml , and the median time to maximal serum concentration ( Tmax ) was 12 hours .
The bioavailability of the 2800 IU vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is similar to 2800 IU vitamin D3 administered alone .
Distribution Following absorption , vitamin D3 enters the blood as part of chylomicrons .
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed mostly to the liver where it undergoes metabolism to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 , the major storage form .
Lesser amounts are distributed to adipose and muscle tissue and stored as vitamin D3 at
Zirkulierendes Vitamin D3 ist an Vitamin-D-bindendes Protein gebunden . Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein .
Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly metabolized by hydroxylation in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 , and subsequently metabolized in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 , which represents the biologically active form .
Further hydroxylation occurs prior to elimination .
A small percentage of vitamin D3 undergoes glucuronidation prior to elimination .
Elimination When radioactive vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects , the mean urinary excretion of radioactivity after 48 hours was 2.4 % , and the mean faecal excretion of radioactivity after 4 days was 4.9 % .
In both cases , the excreted radioactivity was almost exclusively as metabolites of the parent .
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum following an oral dose of ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) is approximately 24 hours .
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies show that alendronate that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine .
No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found after chronic dosing with cumulative intravenous doses up to 35 mg/ kg in animals .
Although no clinical information is available , it is likely that , as in animals , elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function .
Therefore , somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function ( see section 4.2 ) .
Non-clinical studies with the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol have not been conducted .
Alendronate Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential .
Studies in rats have shown that treatment with alendronate during pregnancy was associated with dystocia in dams during parturition which was related to hypocalcaemia .
In studies , rats given high doses showed an increased incidence of incomplete foetal ossification .
The relevance to humans is unknown .
Colecalciferol At doses far higher than the human therapeutic range , reproductive toxicity has been observed in animal studies .

Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients who are not receiving vitamin D supplementation and are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency .
ADROVANCE reduces the risk of vertebral and hip fractures .
The recommended dosage is one ADROVANCE tablet once weekly .
Due to the nature of the disease process in osteoporosis , ADROVANCE is intended for long-term use .
To permit adequate absorption of alendronate :
ADROVANCE must be taken with water only ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage , or medicinal product ( including antacids , calcium supplements and vitamins ) of the day .
Other beverages ( including mineral water ) , food and some medicinal products are likely to reduce the absorption of alendronate ( see section 4.5 ) .
The following instructions should be followed exactly in order to minimize the risk of oesophageal irritation and related adverse reactions ( see section 4.4 ) :
ADROVANCE should only be swallowed after getting up for the day with a full glass of water ( not less than 200ml or 7fl . oz . ) .
Patients should not lie down until after their first food of the day which should be at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
12 Patients should not lie down for at least 30 minutes after taking ADROVANCE .
ADROVANCE should not be taken at bedtime or before arising for the day .
Patients should receive supplemental calcium if intake from diet is inadequate ( see section 4.4 ) .
The equivalence of intake of 5600 IU of vitamin D3 weekly in ADROVANCE to daily dosing of vitamin D 800 IU has not been studied .
In clinical studies there was no age-related difference in the efficacy or safety profiles of alendronate .
Therefore no dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with a glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) greater than 35ml/ min .
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment where GFR is less than 35ml/ min , due to lack of experience .
ADROVANCE has not been studied in children and adolescents and therefore should not be given to them .
Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
Alendronate Alendronate can cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa .
Because there is a potential for worsening of the underlying disease , caution should be used when alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems , such as dysphagia , oesophageal disease , gastritis , duodenitis , ulcers , or with a recent history ( within the previous year ) of major gastrointestinal disease such as peptic ulcer , or active gastrointestinal bleeding , or surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty ( see section 4.3 ) .
Oesophageal reactions ( sometimes severe and requiring hospitalisation ) , such as oesophagitis , oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions , rarely followed by oesophageal stricture , have been reported in patients receiving alendronate .
Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signalling a possible oesophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia , pain on swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn ( see section 4.8 ) .
The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be greater in patients who fail to take alendronate properly and/ or who continue to take alendronate after developing symptoms suggestive of oesophageal irritation .
It is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to , and are understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients should be informed that failure to follow these instructions may increase their risk of oesophageal problems .
13 While no increased risk was observed in extensive clinical trials with alendronate , there have been rare ( post-marketing ) reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers , some of which were severe and with complications ( see section 4.8 ) .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw , generally associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection ( including osteomyelitis ) has been reported in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment regimens including primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates .
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has also been reported in patients with osteoporosis receiving oral bisphosphonates .
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors ( e. g. cancer , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , corticosteroids , poor oral hygiene , periodontal disease ) .
While on treatment , these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible .
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy , dental surgery may exacerbate the condition .
For patients requiring dental procedures , there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw .
Clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment .
Bone , joint , and/ or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates .
In post-marketing experience , these symptoms have rarely been severe and/ or incapacitating ( see section 4.8 ) .
The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting treatment .
Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping treatment .
A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same medicinal product or another bisphosphonate .
Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of ADROVANCE they should take one tablet on the morning after they remember .
They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week , as originally scheduled on their chosen day .
ADROVANCE is not recommended for patients with renal impairment where GFR is less than 35ml/ min ( see section 4.2 ) .
Causes of osteoporosis other than oestrogen deficiency and ageing should be considered .
Hypocalcaemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with ADROVANCE ( see section 4.3 ) .
Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism ) should also be effectively treated before starting ADROVANCE .
The content of vitamin D in ADROVANCE is not suitable for correction of vitamin D deficiency .
In patients with these conditions , serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia should be monitored during therapy with ADROVANCE .
Due to the positive effects of alendronate in increasing bone mineral , decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur .
However , there have been rare reports of symptomatic hypocalcaemia , which have occasionally been severe and often occurred in patients with predisposing conditions ( e. g. hypoparathyroidism , vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
Colecalciferol Vitamin D3 may increase the magnitude of hypercalcaemia and/ or hypercalciuria when administered to patients with disease associated with unregulated overproduction of calcitriol ( e. g. leukaemia , lymphoma , sarcoidosis ) .
Urine and serum calcium should be monitored in these patients .
Patients with malabsorption may not adequately absorb vitamin D3 .
14 Excipients This medicinal product contains lactose and sucrose .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance , galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency , glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicinal product .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Alendronate If taken at the same time , it is likely that food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , antacids , and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate .
Therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
No other clinically significant interactions with medicinal products are anticipated .
A number of patients in the clinical trials received oestrogen ( intravaginal , transdermal , or oral ) while taking alendronate .
No adverse reactions attributable to their concomitant use were identified .
Although specific interaction studies were not performed , in clinical studies alendronate was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed medicinal products without evidence of interactions of clinical relevance .
Colecalciferol Olestra , mineral oils , orlistat , and bile acid sequestrants ( e. g. cholestyramine , colestipol ) may impair the absorption of vitamin D.
Anticonvulsants , cimetidine and thiazides may increase the catabolism of vitamin D.
Additional vitamin D supplements may be considered on an individual basis .
ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and therefore it should not be used during pregnancy or in breast-feeding women .
There are no adequate data from the use of ADROVANCE in pregnant women .
Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy , embryonal/ foetal development , or postnatal development .
Alendronate given during pregnancy in rats caused dystocia related to hypocalcaemia ( see section 5.3 ) .
Studies in animals have shown hypercalcaemia and reproductive toxicity with high doses of vitamin D ( see section 5.3 ) .
It is not known whether alendronate is excreted into human breast milk .
Colecalciferol and some of its active metabolites pass into breast milk .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , there is no information to indicate that ADROVANCE affects a patient s ability to drive or operate machines .
The following adverse reactions have been reported during clinical studies and/ or post-marketing use with alendronate .
No additional adverse reactions have been identified for ADROVANCE .
[ Common ( 1/ 100 , < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1000 , < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 , < 1/ 1000 ) , very rare ( < 1/ 10,000 ) ]
Rare : uveitis , scleritis , episcleritis Common : abdominal pain , dyspepsia , constipation , diarrhoea , flatulence , oesophageal ulcer* , dysphagia* , abdominal distension , acid regurgitation Uncommon : nausea , vomiting , gastritis , oesophagitis* , oesophageal erosions* , melena Rare : oesophageal stricture* , oropharyngeal ulceration* , upper gastrointestinal PUBs ( perforation , ulcers , bleeding)(see section 4.4 ) . *See sections 4.2 and 4.4
Uncommon : rash , pruritus , erythema Rare : rash with photosensitivity Very rare : severe skin reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders :
Metabolism and nutrition disorders :
Common : musculoskeletal ( bone , muscle or joint ) pain Rare : severe musculoskeletal ( bone , muscle or joint ) pain ( see section 4.4 ) Rare : symptomatic hypocalcaemia , often in association with predisposing conditions .
( see section 4.4 ) Rare : transient symptoms as in an acute-phase response ( myalgia , malaise and rarely , fever ) , typically in association with initiation of treatment .
During post-marketing experience the following reactions have been reported ( frequency not known ) :
Osteonekrose des Kiefers wurde bei Patienten unter Bisphosphonaten berichtet ; die meisten Berichte stammen von Krebspatienten , jedoch wurde auch bei Osteoporosepatienten darüber berichtet . The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients , but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw is generally associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including osteomyelitis ) .
Diagnosis of cancer , chemotherapy , radiotherapy , corticosteroids and poor oral hygiene are also deemed as risk factors ( see section 4.4 ) ; joint swelling .
Laboratory test findings In clinical studies , asymptomatic , mild and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18 % and 10 % , respectively , of patients taking alendronate 10 mg/ day versus approximately 12 % and 3 % of those taking placebo .
However , the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to < 8.0 mg/ dl ( 2.0 mmol/ l ) and serum phosphate to 2.0 mg/ dl ( 0.65 mmol/ l ) were similar in both treatment groups .
Alendronate Hypocalcaemia , hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions , such as upset stomach , heartburn , oesophagitis , gastritis , or ulcer , may result from oral overdose .
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with alendronate .
In case of overdose with ADROVANCE , milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate .
Owing to the risk of oesophageal irritation , vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright .
Colecalciferol Vitamin D toxicity has not been documented during chronic therapy in generally healthy adults at a dose less than 10,000 IU/ day .
In a clinical study of healthy adults a 4000 IU daily dose of vitamin D3 for up to five months was not associated with hypercalciuria or hypercalcaemia .
ADROVANCE is a combination tablet containing the two active substances alendronate sodium trihydrate and colecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) .
Alendronate Alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation .
Preclinical studies have shown preferential localisation of alendronate to sites of active resorption .
Activity of osteoclasts is inhibited , but recruitment or attachment of osteoclasts is not affected .
The bone formed during treatment with alendronate is of normal quality .
Colecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 by ultraviolet light .
In the absence of adequate sunlight exposure , vitamin D3 is an essential dietary nutrient .
Vitamin D3 is converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the liver , and stored until needed .
Conversion to the active calcium-mobilizing hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( calcitriol ) in the kidney is tightly regulated .
The principal action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphate as well as regulate serum calcium , renal calcium and phosphate excretion , bone formation and bone resorption .
Vitamin D3 is required for normal bone formation .
Vitamin D insufficiency develops when both sunlight exposure and dietary intake are inadequate .
Insufficiency is associated with negative calcium balance , bone loss , and increased risk of skeletal fracture .
In severe cases , deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism , hypophosphataemia , proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia , further increasing the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals .
Supplemental vitamin D reduces these risks and their consequences .
Osteoporosis is defined as bone mineral density ( BMD ) of the spine or hip 2.5 standard deviations ( SD ) below the mean value of a normal young population or as a previous fragility fracture , irrespective of BMD .
ADROVANCE studies The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE ( alendronate 70 mg/ vitamin D3 2800 IU ) on vitamin D status was demonstrated in a 15-week , multinational study that enrolled 682 osteoporotic post- menopausal women ( serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at baseline : mean , 56 nmol/ l [ 22.3 ng/ ml ] ; range , 22.5-225 nmol/ l [ 9-90 ng/ ml ] ) .
Patients received the lower strength ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) of ADROVANCE ( n=350 ) or FOSAMAX ( alendronate ) 70 mg ( n=332 ) once a week ; additional vitamin
Nach 15-wöchiger Behandlung waren die mittleren Serumspiegel von 25-Hydroxyvitamin D signifikant höher ( 26 % ) in der Gruppe unter ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/2.800 I.E. ) ( 56 nmol/l [ 23 ng/ml ] ) als in der Gruppe unter Alendronat allein ( 46 nmol/l [ 18,2 ng/ml ] ) . After 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) group ( 56 nmol/ l [ 23 ng/ ml ] ) than in the alendronate-only group ( 46 nmol/ l [ 18.2 ng/ ml ] ) .
The percentage of patients with vitamin D insufficiency ( serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 37.5 nmol/ l [ < 15 ng/ ml ] ) was significantly reduced by 62.5 % with ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) vs. alendronate-only ( 12 % vs.
32 % , respectively ) , through week 15.
The percentage of patients with vitamin D deficiency ( serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D < 22.5 nmol/ l [ < 9 ng/ ml ] ) was significantly reduced by 92 % with ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) vs. alendronate-only ( 1 % vs 13 % , respectively ) .
In this study , mean 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels in patients with vitamin D insufficiency at baseline ( 25- hydroxyvitamin D , 22.5 to 37.5 nmol/ l [ 9 to < 15 ng/ ml ] ) increased from 30 nmol/ l ( 12.1 ng/ ml ) to 40 nmol/ l ( 15.9 ng/ ml ) at week 15 in the ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) group ( n=75 ) and decreased from 30 nmol/ l ( 12.0 ng/ ml ) at baseline to 26 nmol/ l ( 10.4 ng/ ml ) at week 15 in the alendronate-only group ( n=70 ) .
There were no differences in mean serum calcium , phosphate , or 24-hour urine calcium between treatment groups .
The effect of the lower dose of ADROVANCE ( alendronate 70 mg/ vitamin D3 2800 IU ) plus an additional 2800 IU Vitamin D3 for a total of 5600 IU ( the amount of vitamin D3 in the higher dose of ADROVANCE ) once weekly was demonstrated in a 24-week , extension study that enrolled 619 osteoporotic post-menopausal women .
Patients in the Vitamin D3 2800 group received ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) ( n=299 ) and patients in the Vitamin D3 5600 group received ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) plus an additional 2800 IU vitamin D3 ( n=309 ) once a week ; additional vitamin D supplements were allowed .
After 24-weeks of treatment , the mean serum 25- hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher in the Vitamin D3 5600 group ( 69 nmol/ l [ 27.6 ng/ ml ] ) than in the Vitamin D3 2800 group ( 64 nmol/ l [ 25.5 ng/ ml ] ) .
The percentage of patients with vitamin D insufficiency was 5.4 % in the Vitamin D3 2800 group vs.
3.2 % in the Vitamin D3 5600 group through the 24-week extension .
The percentage of patients with vitamin D deficiency was 0.3 % in the Vitamin D3 2800 group vs. zero in the Vitamin D3 5600 group .
There were no differences in mean serum calcium , phosphate , or 24-hour urine calcium between treatment groups .
The percentage of patients with hypercalciuria at the end of the 24-week extension was not statistically different between treatment groups .
Alendronate studies The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once weekly 70 mg ( n=519 ) and alendronate 10 mg daily ( n=370 ) was demonstrated in a one-year multicentre study of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis .
The mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at one year were 5.1 % ( 95 % CI :
4.8 , 5.4 % ) in the 70 mg once-weekly group and 5.4 % ( 95 % CI :
5.0 , 5.8 % ) in the 10 mg daily group .
The mean BMD increases were 2.3 % and 2.9 % at the femoral neck and 2.9 % and 3.1 % at the total hip in the 70 mg once weekly and 10 mg daily groups , respectively .
The two treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites .
The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were examined in two initial efficacy studies of identical design ( n=994 ) as well as in the Fracture Intervention Trial ( FIT : n=6,459 ) .
In the initial efficacy studies , the mean BMD increases with alendronate 10 mg/ day relative to placebo at three years were 8.8 % , 5.9 % and 7.8 % at the spine , femoral neck and trochanter , respectively .
Total body BMD also increased significantly .
There was a 48 % reduction ( alendronate 3.2 % vs placebo 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo .
In the two-year extension of these studies BMD at the spine and trochanter continued to increase and BMD at the femoral neck and total body were maintained .
FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies using alendronate daily ( 5 mg daily for two years and 10 mg daily for either one or two additional years ) :
FIT 1 : eine Drei-Jahres-Studie an 2.027 Patientinnen mit mindestens einer vorbestehenden Wirbel-(Kompressions-)Fraktur . A three-year study of 2,027 patients who had at least one baseline vertebral ( compression ) fracture .
In this study alendronate daily reduced the incidence of 1 new 18 vertebral fracture by 47 % ( alendronate 7.9 % vs. placebo 15.0 % ) .
Zusätzlich wurde eine signifikante Reduktion der Inzidenz von Hüftfrakturen ( 1,1 % gegenüber 2,2 % ; Reduktion um 51 % ) festgestellt . 2.2 % , a reduction of 51 % ) .
FIT 2 : eine Vier-Jahres-Studie an 4.432 Patientinnen mit einer niedrigen Knochenmasse , aber ohne vorbestehende Wirbelfraktur . A four-year study of 4,432 patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture .
In dieser Studie wurde in der Analyse der Subgruppe mit osteoporotischen Frauen ( 37 % der Gesamtzahl , die nach der o. g. Definition an Osteoporose litten ) ein signifikanter Unterschied in der Inzidenz von Hüftfrakturen ( Alendronat 1,0 % gegenüber Plazebo 2,2 % ; Reduktion um 56 % ) und in der Inzidenz von mindestens einer Wirbelfraktur ( 2,9 % gegenüber 5,8 % ; Reduktion um 50 % ) beobachtet . 5.8 % , a reduction of 50 % ) .
Absorption Relative to an intravenous reference dose , the oral mean bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardised breakfast .
Bioavailability was decreased similarly to an estimated 0.46 % and 0.39 % when alendronate was administered one hour or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
In osteoporosis studies , alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before the first food or beverage of the day .
The alendronate component in the ADROVANCE ( 70mg/ 5600 IU ) combination tablet is bioequivalent to the alendronate 70 mg tablet .
Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate was administered with , or up to two hours after , a standardised breakfast .
Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60 % .
In healthy subjects , oral prednisone ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate ( a mean increase ranging from 20 % to 44 % ) .
Distribution Studies in rats show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/ kg intravenous administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine .
The mean steady-state volume of distribution , exclusive of bone , is at least 28 litres in humans .
Concentrations of alendronate in plasma following therapeutic oral doses are too low for analytical detection ( < 5 ng/ ml ) .
Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78 % .
Biotransformation There is no evidence that alendronate is metabolised in animals or humans .
Elimination Following a single intravenous dose of [ 14C]alendronate , approximately 50 % of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces .
Following a single 10 mg intravenous dose , the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min , and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min .
Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95 % within six hours following intravenous administration .
The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed ten years , reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton .
Alendronate is not excreted through the acidic or basic transport systems of the kidney in rats , and thus it is not anticipated to interfere with the excretion of other medicinal products by those systems in humans .
Absorption In healthy adult subjects ( males and females ) , following administration of ADROVANCE 70 mg/ 5600 IU after an overnight fast and two hours before a meal , the mean area under the serum- concentration-time curve ( AUC0-80 hrs ) for vitamin D3 ( unadjusted for endogenous vitamin D3 levels ) was 490.2 ng hr/ ml .
The mean maximal serum concentration ( Cmax ) of vitamin D3 was 12.2 ng/ ml and the median time to maximal serum concentration ( Tmax ) was 10.6 hours .
The bioavailability of the 5600 IU vitamin D3 in ADROVANCE is similar to 5600 IU vitamin D3 administered alone .
Distribution Following absorption , vitamin D3 enters the blood as part of chylomicrons .
Vitamin D3 is rapidly distributed mostly to the liver where it undergoes metabolism to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 , the major storage form .
Lesser amounts are distributed to adipose and muscle tissue and stored as vitamin D3 at these sites for later release into the circulation .
Circulating vitamin D3 is bound to vitamin D-binding protein .
Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly metabolized by hydroxylation in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 , and subsequently metabolized in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 , which represents the biologically active form .
Further hydroxylation occurs prior to elimination .
A small percentage of vitamin D3 undergoes glucuronidation prior to elimination .
Elimination When radioactive vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects , the mean urinary excretion of radioactivity after 48 hours was 2.4 % , and the mean faecal excretion of radioactivity after 4 days was 4.9 % .
In both cases , the excreted radioactivity was almost exclusively as metabolites of the parent .
The mean half-life of vitamin D3 in the serum following an oral dose of ADROVANCE ( 70 mg/ 2800 IU ) is approximately 24 hours .
Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies show that alendronate that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine .
No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found after chronic dosing with cumulative intravenous doses up to 35 mg/ kg in animals .
Although no clinical information is available , it is likely that , as in animals , elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function .
Therefore , somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function ( see section 4.2 ) .
Non-clinical studies with the combination of alendronate and colecalciferol have not been conducted .
Alendronate Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential .
Studies in rats have shown that treatment with alendronate during pregnancy was associated with dystocia in dams during parturition which was related to hypocalcaemia .
In studies , rats given high doses showed an increased incidence of incomplete foetal ossification .
The relevance to humans is unknown .
Colecalciferol At doses far higher than the human therapeutic range , reproductive toxicity has been observed in animal studies .

Advate is a powder and solvent that are mixed together to make a solution for injection .
Advate contains the active substance octocog alfa ( human coagulation factor VIII ) .
Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII ) .
Advate is intended for either short-term or long-term use .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
Advate should be started by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of haemophilia .
Advate is given by injection into a vein at a rate of up to 10 ml per minute .
The dose and frequency depend on whether Advate is used to treat haemorrhage ( bleeding ) or to prevent it during surgery .
The dose is also adjusted depending on the severity of the haemorrhage or the type of surgery .
Full details on how to calculate the doses are included in the Package Leaflet .
The active substance in Advate , octocog alfa , is a blood coagulation factor protein .
In the body , factor VIII is one of the substances ( factors ) involved in blood coagulation ( clotting ) .
Patients with haemophilia A lack factor VIII , and this causes blood coagulation problems , such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Advate is used to replace the missing factor VIII .
It corrects the factor VIII deficiency and gives temporary control of the bleeding disorder .
Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method known as recombinant DNA technology : it is made by a cell that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce human coagulation factor VIII .
Es wird von einer Zelle produziert , in die ein Gen ( DNA ) eingebracht wurde , das sie zur Bildung des menschlichen Gerinnungsfaktors VIII befähigt . Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) called Recombinate , but it is prepared differently so that there are no human- or animal-derived proteins in the medicine .

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged . of bleeding episodes and rated Advate s effectiveness in stopping bleeding on a scale from none to excellent in 107 patients , all of whom received Advate .
Three additional studies looked at the use of the medicine in the prevention of bleeding and in surgery in patients with severe or moderately severe haemophilia A , including one study in 53 children under the age of six years .
What benefit has Advate shown during the studies ?
In the main study , the effectiveness of Advate in the prevention of bleeding was rated as excellent or good in 86 % of the 510 new bleeding episodes .
In addition , 81 % of these bleeding episodes required only a single treatment with Advate .
The additional studies confirmed Advate s effectiveness , including in children under six years of age .
Haemophilia A patients may develop antibodies ( inhibitors ) to factor VIII .
An antibody is a protein produced by the body in reaction to unknown agents as part of the natural defence system of the body .
If antibodies develop , Advate will not work effectively .
The most common side effects with Advate ( seen in between 1 to 10 patients in 100 ) are dizziness , headache , pyrexia ( fever ) and the presence of antibodies against factor VIII .
Hypersensitivity ( allergic reactions ) has sometimes been seen in patients treated with factor VIII-containing products .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Advate , see the Package Leaflet .
Advate should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to human coagulation factor VIII , to mouse or hamster protein , or to any of the other ingredients .
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel ( CHMP ) gelangte zu dem Schluss , dass die Vorteile von Advate bei der Behandlung und Propyhlaxe von Blutungen bei Patienten mit Hämophilie A ( angeborener Mangel an Faktor VIII ) gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen , und empfahl , die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von Advate zu erteilen . The Committee recommended that Advate be given marketing authorisation .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Advate to Baxter AG on 2 March 2004.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 2 March 2009.
The full EPAR for Advate is available here .
powder : vial ( glass ) ; solvent : vial ( glass )
1 vial + 1 vial + reconstitution device
ADVATE 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection
Each vial contains nominally 250 IU* human coagulation factor VIII ( rDNA ) , octocog alfa** .
After reconstitution , each ml solution for injection contains approximately 50 IU octocog alfa . * The potency ( International Units ) is determined using the chromogenic assay against an in-house standard that is referenced to the WHO standard .
The specific activity is approximately 4,000- 10,000 IU/ mg protein . ** Human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells .
Prepared without the addition of any ( exogenous ) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process , purification or final formulation .
0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
After reconstitution , the solution is clear , colourless , free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3 .
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU
2 factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor ) , doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 1 gemeldet . 1

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
6 The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 2 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antihaemorrhagics , blood coagulation factor VIII .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions . ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Hämophilie A ist eine geschlechtsgebundene , erbliche Störung der Blutgerinnung aufgrund erniedrigter Faktor VIII-Spiegel . The plasma levels of factor VIII are
2 paediatric patients ( age 0 16 years ) and adult patients ( age over 16 years )
7 increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

PK Parameter AUC0- ( IU h/ dl ) t1/ 2 ( h ) Adjusted Recovery
( IU/ dl/ IU/ kg ) Cmax ( IU/ dl ) Clearance ( dl/ kg h ) MRT ( h ) VSS ( dl/ kg ) * Geometric Mean
Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life ( t1/ 2 ) was approximately 20 % lower in young children ( less than 6 years of age ) than in adults , which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients .
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology , acute toxicology , repeated dose toxicity , local toxicity and genotoxicity .

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
12 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 13 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
14 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 3 gemeldet . 3

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
16 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 4 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antihaemorrhagics , blood coagulation factor VIII .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 17 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life ( t1/ 2 ) was approximately 20 % lower in young children ( less than 6 years of age ) than in adults , which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients .
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available .

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
22 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 23 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
24 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 5 gemeldet . 5
Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention : very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000 ) , very rare ( < 1/ 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be calculated from the available data ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
26 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 6 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antihaemorrhagics , blood coagulation factor VIII .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 27 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life ( t1/ 2 ) was approximately 20 % lower in young children ( less than 6 years of age ) than in adults , which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients .
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available .

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
32 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 33 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
34 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 7 gemeldet . 7

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
36 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 8 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antihaemorrhagics , blood coagulation factor VIII .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 37 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life ( t1/ 2 ) was approximately 20 % lower in young children ( less than 6 years of age ) than in adults , which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients .
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available .

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
42 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 43 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
44 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 9 gemeldet . 9

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
46 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 10 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antihaemorrhagics , blood coagulation factor VIII .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 47 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
52 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 53 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
54 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
56 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 12 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .

ADVATE 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection Octocog alfa ( recombinant human coagulation factor VIII )
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine .
- If you have any further questions , ask your doctor .
- This medicine has been prescribed for you .
Es darf nicht an Dritte weitergegeben werden . It may harm them , even
if their symptoms are the same as yours .
- If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet ,
please tell your doctor .
What ADVATE is and what it is used for 2.
Before you use ADVATE 3.
WHAT ADVATE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
ADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa , human coagulation factor VIII produced by recombinant DNA technology .
Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings .
In patients with haemophilia A ( inborn factor VIII deficiency ) , it is missing or not working properly .
ADVATE is used in patients with haemophilia A for prevention or treatment of spontaneous or surgery-related bleeding .
ADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process , purification or final formulation .
BEFORE YOU USE ADVATE
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of ADVATE
- if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins
If you are unsure about this , ask your doctor .
Take special care with ADVATE You should tell your doctor if you have been previously treated with Factor VIII products , especially if you developed inhibitors , since there might be a higher risk that it happens again .
Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding .
Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the treatment of haemophilia A.
If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE , tell your doctor immediately .
There is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction ( a severe , sudden allergic reaction ) to ADVATE .
Sie sollten über frühe Anzeichen einer solchen These symptoms can constitute an early
92 symptom of an anaphylactic shock , manifestations of which may additionally include extreme dizziness , loss of consciousness , and extreme difficulty in breathing .
If any of these symptoms occur , stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor .
Severe symptoms , including difficulty in breathing and ( near ) fainting , require prompt emergency treatment .
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding .
Your doctor will decide if ADVATE may be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding .
Driving and using machines ADVATE has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines .
Important information about some of the ingredients of ADVATE This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE ( in international units or IU ) depending on your condition and body weight , and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding .
The frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you .
Usually , the replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment .
Prevention of bleeding The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight , administered every 2 to 3 days.
However , in some cases , especially in younger patients , more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary .
Treatment of bleeding The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on you body weight and the factor VIII levels to be achieved .
The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding .
Dose ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired Factor VIII rise ( % of normal ) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient , talk to your doctor .
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII levels .
This is particularly important if you are having major surgery .
93 Patients developing Factor VIII inhibitors If your plasma Factor VIII fails to reach expected levels with ADVATE , or if bleeding is not adequately controlled , it could be due to the development of Factor VIII inhibitors .
This will be checked by your doctor .
You might need a higher dose of ADVATE or even a different product to control bleedings .
Do not increase the total dose of ADVATE to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor .
How ADVATE is given ADVATE is usually injected into a vein ( intravenously ) by your doctor or nurse .
You or someone else might also administer ADVATE as an injection , but only after receiving adequate training .
Detailed instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet .
If you use more ADVATE than you should Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you .
You should check with your doctor if you are not sure .
If you inject more ADVATE than recommended , tell your doctor as soon as possible .
If you forget to use ADVATE Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose .
Proceed with the next injection as scheduled immediately and continue as advised by your doctor .
If you stop using ADVATE Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor .
If you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor .

Questions and answers on the withdrawal of the marketing application for Advexin
International non-proprietary name ( INN ) : contusugene ladenovec
On 17 December 2008 , Gendux Molecular Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer .
Advexin was designated as an orphan medicinal product on 23 October 2006.
Advexin is a suspension for injection that contains contusugene ladenovec , a genetically modified virus which carries the p53 gene .
What was Advexin expected to be used for ?
Advexin was expected to be used to treat Li-Fraumeni cancer in patients from the age of 18 years .
Li-Fraumeni cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome , a condition where a gene called p53 is defective because of a mutation .
People who have this mutation are more likely to develop cancer .
Li-Fraumeni cancer can occur in many areas of the body but usually affects the breast , brain , bone or soft tissue ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) .
The active substance in Advexin , contusugene ladenovec , is a viral vector .
This is a type of virus that has been altered genetically so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
The virus in Advexin is an adenovirus that has been engineered so that it cannot make copies of itself and therefore does not cause infections in humans .
The gene carried by the virus in Advexin is the normal ( non-defective ) p53 gene .
Advexin was expected to be injected directly into the tumours , thus allowing the cancer cells to produce normal p53 protein again .
The p53 protein , which is produced from the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body , normally contributes to the repair of damaged DNA and causes cell death when the DNA cannot be repaired .
Because cancer cells contain damaged DNA , the p53 protein either helps to repair the DNA or causes the cells to die .
In Li-Fraumeni cancer , where the p53 gene is defective , the p53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
Advexin was expected to cure or slow down the disease by restoring the normal protective function of the cells .
What documentation did the company present to support its application to the CHMP ?
The effects of Advexin were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
The company presented information from a study on one patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the lower abdomen , the bones and the brain .
Der Patient erhielt über einen Zeitraum von fünf Monaten 12 Advexin-Injektionen , die in einige der Tumore gespritzt wurden . The effectiveness of the medicine was assessed by using scans to look at how the tumours responded to treatment .

Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged .
How far into the evaluation was the application when it was withdrawn ?
The application was at day 179 when the company withdrew .
After the CHMP had assessed the responses from the company to a list of questions , there were still some unresolved issues outstanding .
The CHMP normally takes up to 210 days to evaluate a new application .
Based on the review of the initial documentation , the CHMP prepares a list of questions at day 120 , which is sent to the company .
Once the company has supplied responses to the questions , the CHMP reviews them and may , before giving an opinion , ask any remaining questions at day 180.
Following the CHMP s opinion , it usually takes around two months for the European Commission to grant a licence .
What was the recommendation of the CHMP at that time ?
Based on the review of the data and the company s response to the CHMP list of questions , at the time of the withdrawal , the CHMP had some concerns and was of the provisional opinion that Advexin could not have been approved for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer .
What were the main concerns of the CHMP ?
The CHMP was concerned that there was not enough evidence to show that the injection of Advexin into Li-Fraumeni tumours led to benefits for patients .
The Committee also had concerns over what happens to the medicine in the body , how it should be given and how safe it is .
In addition , the company had not supplied enough evidence to demonstrate that Advexin could be made in a reliable manner , or that it would not be harmful to the environment or to people in close contact with the patient .
What were the reasons given by the company to withdraw the application ?
The letter from the company notifying the EMEA of the withdrawal of the application is available here .
What are the consequences of the withdrawal for patients undergoing clinical trials or compassionate use programmes with Advexin ?
The company did not inform the CHMP whether there were any consequences of the withdrawal for patients in clinical trials or compassionate use programmes with Advexin .
Das vorliegende Dokument ist eine Zusammenfassung des Europäischen Öffentlichen Beurteilungsberichts ( EPAR ) , in dem erläutert wird , wie der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel ( CHMP ) die durchgeführten Studien beurteilt hat , um zu Empfehlungen bezüglich der Anwendung des Arzneimittels zu gelangen . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .

Aerinaze is a medicine containing the active substances desloratadine ( 2.5 mg ) and pseudoephedrine ( 120 mg ) .
It is available as blue and white modified-release tablets . Modified-release means that the tablets have been made to allow one of the active substances to be released immediately and the other one released over a few hours .
Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis ( hayfever , inflammation of the nasal passages caused by an allergy to pollen ) in patients who have nasal congestion ( a blocked nose ) .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
In adults and adolescents over 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aerinaze is one tablet twice a day , taken whole with a full glass of water , with or without food .
Treatment should continue for as short a time as possible and should stop when symptoms , chiefly the congestion ( blocked nose ) , have disappeared .
Treatment for more than 10 days is not advisable , as the medicine s effects on nasal congestion may wear off .
Once the nose has cleared , patients can use desloratadine alone .
Aerinaze contains two active substances : desloratadine , an antihistamine , and pseudoephedrine , which is a nasal decongestant .
Desloratadine works by blocking the receptors on which histamine , a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms , normally fixes itself .
When the receptors are blocked , histamine cannot have its effect , and this leads to a decrease in the symptoms of allergy .
Wenn die Rezeptoren blockiert sind , kann Histamin seine Wirkung nicht entfalten , und dies führt zur Linderung der Allergiesymptome . This reduces the amount of fluid released from the vessels , resulting in less swelling and less mucus production in the nose .
In Aerinaze , the two active substances are used together , since an antihistamine alone may not provide adequate relief for patients with nasal congestion .
Aerinaze tablets have two layers , one containing desloratadine , and the other containing pseudoephedrine .
In Aerinaze werden zwei arzneilich wirksame Bestandteile kombiniert , weil ein Antihistaminikum allein bei Patienten mit Verstopfung der Nase häufig keine ausreichende Linderung der Symptome bewirkt . This means that patients only need to take the tablet twice a day .

The effectiveness of Aerinaze was assessed in two main studies involving a total of 1,248 adult and adolescent patients .
In both studies , Aerinaze was compared with desloratadine alone and with pseudoephedrine alone .
The main measures of effectiveness were the change in the severity of hayfever symptoms reported by the patients between before treatment started , and over the entire 15 days of treatment .
The patients recorded their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours during the study , scoring on a standard symptom scale how severe the symptoms were over the previous 12-hour period .
What benefit has Aerinaze shown during the studies ?
Aerinaze was more effective in reducing symptoms than either of the two active substances taken alone .
When looking at all hayfever symptoms except for nasal congestion , patients taking Aerinaze reported a reduction in symptoms of 46.0 % , compared with 35.9 % in those taking pseudoephedrine alone .
When looking at nasal congestion , patients taking Aerinaze had a reduction in symptoms of 37.4 % , compared with 26.7 % in those taking desloratadine alone .
Similar results were seen in the second study .
The most common side effects with Aerinaze ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are tachycardia ( fast heart rate ) , dry mouth , dizziness , psychomotor hyperactivity ( restlessness ) , pharyngitis ( sore throat ) , anorexia ( loss of appetite ) , constipation , headache , fatigue ( tiredness ) , insomnia ( difficulty sleeping ) , somnolence ( sleepiness ) , sleep disorders and nervousness .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Aerinaze , see the Package Leaflet .
Aerinaze should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to desloratadine , pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients , to adrenergic agents or to loratadine ( another medicine used to treat allergies ) .
It should not be used in people who are taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( such as some medicines used to treat depression ) or who have stopped taking one of these medicines within the last two weeks .
Aerinaze should also not be taken by people who have narrow- angle glaucoma ( increased pressure inside the eye ) , urinary retention ( difficulty in passing urine ) , heart or blood vessel diseases including hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , hyperthyroidism ( an overactive thyroid gland ) , or a history or risk of haemorrhagic stroke ( stroke caused by bleeding within the brain ) .
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel ( CHMP ) gelangte zu dem Schluss , dass die Vorteile von Aerinaze bei der symptomatischen Behandlung der saisonalen allergischen Rhinitis mit Nasenschleimhautschwellung gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen , und empfahl , die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von Aerinaze zu erteilen . The Committee recommended that Aerinaze be given marketing authorisation .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aerinaze to SP Europe on 30 July 2007.

Each tablet contains 2.5 mg desloratadine and 120 mg pseudoephedrine ( as sulphate ) .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Blue and white bilayer oval tablet with D12 branded to blue layer .
Symptomatic treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis when accompanied by nasal congestion .
Adults and adolescents 12 years of age and over :
The recommended dose of Aerinaze is one tablet twice a day .
The tablet may be taken with a full glass of water but must be swallowed entirely ( without crushing , breaking or chewing it ) .
The tablet may be taken with or without food .
Aerinaze should not be used in children below the age of 12 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
The duration of treatment should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have disappeared .
It is advisable to limit treatment to about 10 days , as during chronic administration the activity of pseudoephedrine may diminish .
After improvement of the congestive condition of the mucosae of the upper airway , treatment may be maintained with desloratadine alone , if necessary .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance , to any of the excipients , to adrenergic agents or to loratadine .
As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine , it is also contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitor therapy or during the 2 weeks following the stopping of such treatment .
Aerinaze is also contraindicated in patients with : narrow-angle glaucoma , urinary retention , cardiovascular diseases such as ischaemic heart disease , tachyarrhythmia and severe hypertension , hyperthyroidism ,
2 a history of haemorrhagic stroke or with risk factors which could increase the risk of haemorrhagic stroke .
This is due to the alpha-mimetic activity of pseudoephedrine in combination with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitine , pergolide , lisuride , cabergoline , ergotamine , dihydroergotamine or any other decongestant medicinal product used as a nasal decongestant , either by oral route or by nasal route ( phenylpropanolamine , phenylephrine , ephedrine , oxymetazoline , naphazoline ) .
Do not exceed the recommended dosage and the duration of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients of 60 years or older are more likely to experience adverse reactions to sympathomimetic medicinal products , such as pseudoephedrine .
The safety and efficacy of the combination have not been established in this population , and there are insufficient data to give adequate dose recommendations .
Therefore the combination product should be used with caution in patients above 60 years of age .
The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze has not been established in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function , and there are insufficient data to give adequate dose recommendations .
The combination product is not recommended for use in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function .
Aerinaze should not be used in children below the age of 12 years ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients should be informed that the treatment should be discontinued in case of hypertension , tachycardia , palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias , nausea or any other neurological sign ( such as headache or increased headache ) .
Central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension may be produced by sympathomimetic amines .
These effects may be more likely to occur in children , elderly patients , or in cases of overdose ( see section 4.9 ) .
Caution should be exercised in the following patient groups : Patients receiving digitalis Patients with cardiac arrhythmias Patients with hypertension Patients with a history of myocardial infarction , diabetes mellitus , bladder neck obstruction , or positive anamnesis of bronchospasm .
Use with caution in patients with stenosing peptic ulcer , pyloroduodenal obstruction , and obstruction of the vesical cervix .
Caution should also be exercised in patients being treated with other sympathomimetics .
These include : decongestants anorexogenics or amphetamine-type psychostimulants antihypertensive agents tricyclic antidepressants and other antihistamines .
Caution should be exercised in patients suffering from migraine who are currently being treated with ergot alkaloid vasoconstrictors .
Continuous use can lead to tolerance resulting in an increased risk of overdosing .
3 Perioperative acute hypertension can occur if volatile halogenated anaesthetics are used during treatment with indirect sympathomimetic agents .
Therefore , if surgery is scheduled , it is preferable to discontinue treatment 24 hours before anaesthesia .
Athletes should be informed that treatment with pseudoephedrine could lead to positive doping tests .
The administration of Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours before skin tests since antihistamines maybe prevent or reduce other wise positive reaction to dermal reactivity index .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
However , no clinically relevant interactions or changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered .
Reversible and irreversible MAO inhibitor(s ) may cause : risk of vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure .
Concurrent administration with sympathomimetic medicines may result in critical hypertension reactions .
The following combinations are not recommended : bromocriptine cabergoline lisuride , pergolide : risk of vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure .
Dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , methylergometrine : risk of vasoconstriction and increase in blood pressure .
Other vasoconstrictors used as nasal decongestant , by oral or nasal route ( phenylpropanolamine , phenylephrine , ephedrine , oxymetazoline , naphazoline ) : risk of vasoconstriction .
Sympathomimetic medicines reduce the antihypertensive effect of -methyldopa , mecamylamine , reserpine , veratrum alkaloids , and guanethidine .
Antacids increase the rate of pseudoephedrine sulphate absorption , kaolin decreases it .
The interaction with Aerinaze and alcohol has not been studied .
However , in a clinical pharmacology trial desloratadine taken concomitantly with alcohol did not potentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol .
No significant differences were found in the psychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups , whether administered alone or with alcohol .
The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet , and therefore , some interactions with other medicinal products can not be fully excluded .
Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein .
Neither desloratadine nor the combination of loratadine and pseudoephedrine were teratogenic in animal studies .
The safe use of Aerinaze during pregnancy has not been established ; however experience from a large number of exposed pregnancies in humans does not reveal any increase in the frequency of malformations as compared to the incidence in the general population .
4 Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine , Aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy .
Desloratadine and pseudoephedrine are both excreted in breast milk .
Decreased milk production in nursing mothers has been reported with pseudoephedrine .
Therefore Aerinaze should not be used in breast-feeding women .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed with Aerinaze .
In clinical trials that assessed the driving ability , no impairment occurred in patients receiving desloratadine .
However , patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness , which may affect their ability to drive or use machines .
It is not expected that pseudoephedrine sulphate impairs psychomotor performance .
In clinical trials involving 414 adults the most frequent of adverse events reported were insomnia ( 8.9 % ) , dry mouth ( 7.2 % ) and headache ( 3.1 % ) .
These and other undesirable effects reported during the clinical trials are listed in the following table .
