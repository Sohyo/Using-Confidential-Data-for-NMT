Abilify is a medicine containing the active substance aripiprazole .
It is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as an oral solution ( 1 mg/ ml ) and as a solution for injection ( 7.5 mg/ ml ) .
Abilify is used to treat adults with the following mental illnesses : schizophrenia , a mental illness with a number of symptoms , including disorganised thinking and speech , hallucinations ( hearing or seeing things that are not there ) , suspiciousness and delusions ( mistaken beliefs ) ; bipolar I disorder , a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes ( periods of abnormally high mood ) , alternating with periods of normal mood .
Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
The solution for injection is used for the rapid control of agitation or disturbed behaviour when taking the medicine by mouth is not appropriate .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
For schizophrenia , the recommended starting dose is 10 or 15 mg by mouth per day .
The maintenance dose is 15 mg once a day , but higher doses may benefit some patients .
Bei bipolarer Störung beträgt die empfohlene Anfangsdosis zum Einnehmen 15 mg einmal täglich , entweder allein oder in Kombination mit anderen Arzneimitteln . Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
Bei einigen Patienten kann auch eine höhere Dosis hilfreich sein . For both illnesses , the oral solution or orodispersible tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets .
The orodispersible tablets are taken by being placed on the tongue , where they disintegrate quickly in the saliva , or by mixing them in water before swallowing .
The solution for injection is only for short-term use and should be replaced by tablets , orodispersible tablets or oral solution as soon as possible : the usual dose is 9.75 mg as a single injection into the upper arm or buttock muscle , but effective doses range between 5.25 and 15 mg .

Abilify can be taken with or without food .
The daily dose of Abilify should not exceed 30 mg , but this dose should be used with caution in patients who have severe problems with their liver .
The dose of Abilify should be adjusted in patients who are taking other medicines that are broken down in the same way as Abilify .
Abilify has not been studied in children aged below 18 years or adults aged over 65 years .
For more information , see the Package Leaflet .
The active substance in Abilify , aripiprazole , is an antipsychotic medicine .
Its exact mechanism of action is unknown , but it attaches to several different receptors on the surface of nerve cells in the brain .
This disrupts signals transmitted between brain cells by neurotransmitters , chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other .
Aripiprazole is thought to act mainly by being a partial agonist for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine ( also called serotonin ) .
This means that aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine to activate the receptors , but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters .
Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , aripiprazole helps to normalise the activity of the brain , reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing them from returning .
For the treatment of schizophrenia , there were three main short-term studies of Abilify tablets lasting four to six weeks , which involved 1,203 patients and compared Abilify with placebo ( a dummy treatment ) .
The effectiveness of Abilify in preventing symptoms from returning was assessed in three studies lasting up to a year , two of which used haloperidol ( another antipsychotic medicine ) as a comparator .
The effectiveness of the solution for injection was compared with placebo over a period of two hours in two studies involving 805 patients with schizophrenia or related conditions who were experiencing symptoms of agitation .
All of the studies measured the change in the patient s symptoms using a standard scale for schizophrenia .
For the treatment of bipolar disorder , there were eight main studies looking at Abilify taken by mouth .
There were five short-term studies that compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo over three weeks in a total of 1,900 patients .
Two of these studies used haloperidol and lithium ( another antipsychotic medicine ) as comparators and continued for a further nine weeks to look at the maintenance of the effect of the medicines .
Another study compared Abilify with haloperidol over 12 weeks in 347 patients , and a further study compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo in preventing recurrence in 160 patients whose manic symptoms had already been stabilised using Abilify .
The eighth study looked at the effect of adding Abilify or placebo to existing treatment with lithium or valproate ( another antipsychotic medicine ) in 384 patients .
The effectiveness of Abilify solution for injection was compared with that of lorazepam ( another antipsychotic medicine ) and of placebo over a period of two hours in one study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder who were experiencing symptoms of agitation .
All of these studies looked at the change in symptoms using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or at the number of patients who responded to treatment .
The company also carried out studies looking at the absorption of the orodispersible tablets and oral solution by the body .
What benefit has Abilify shown during the studies ?
When used to treat schizophrenia , Abilify was more effective than placebo in the short-term studies .
In the long-term studies , Abilify was more effective than placebo , and as effective as haloperidol , after up to a year of treatment .
In both studies of the solution for injection , patients receiving Abilify at doses of 5.25 , 9.75 or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of agitation than those receiving placebo .
When used to treat bipolar disorder , Abilify was more effective than placebo at reducing manic symptoms in four of the five short-term studies .
Abilify also had a similar effect to haloperidol and to lithium over three weeks .
This effect was maintained for up to 12 weeks .
Abilify was also more effective than placebo at preventing manic episodes returning in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks , and when it was used as an add-on to existing treatment .
Injections of Abilify at doses of 10 or 15 mg were also more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of agitation , and were of similar effectiveness to lorazepam .
2/ 3 What is the risk associated with Abilify ?
The most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth ( seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100 ) are extrapyramidal disorder ( uncontrolled twitching or jerking ) , akathisia ( constant urge to move ) , tremor ( shaking ) , somnolence ( sleepiness ) , sedation ( drowsiness ) , headache , blurred vision , dyspepsia ( heartburn ) , vomiting , nausea ( feeling sick ) , constipation , salivary hypersecretion ( increased production of saliva ) , fatigue ( tiredness ) , restlessness , insomnia ( difficulty sleeping ) and anxiety .
Akathisia is more common in patients with bipolar disorder than in those with schizophrenia .
Between 1 and 10 patients in 100 receiving injections of Abilify experience somnolence , dizziness , headache , akathisia , nausea and vomiting .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abilify , see the Package Leaflet .
Abilify should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to aripiprazole or any of the other ingredients .
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Abilify s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder , and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment .
It also decided that the benefits of the solution for injection outweighed its risks for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
The Committee recommended that Abilify be given marketing authorisation .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Abilify to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. on 4 June 2004.

OVERALL SUMMARY OF THE SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF VANTAS ( see Annex I )
Early in its natural cycle , prostate cancer is androgen dependent .
Late in the clinical course , it is androgen independent , and is refractory to hormonal therapy .
However , even in the androgen- independent state , prostate cancer is likely to contain subpopulations of cells that are androgen dependent .
On the basis of these limited data , continued androgen suppression in men with androgen- independent prostate cancer ( AIPC ) is the current standard of care .
In the past , testosterone suppression was achieved by bilateral orchiectomy ( surgical castration ) .
For the last two decades , injection of long-acting luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists ( LH-RHas ) has been used to achieve androgen ablation .
In principle , it is important to achieve serum testosterone concentrations as low as possible for ADT to minimize stimulation of prostate cancer cells .
Serum testosterone concentrations that correspond to castration levels have generally been set at less than 50 ng/ dL ( 1.7 nmol/ L ) , given the known variability of values in reference laboratories .
The achievement of castrate levels of testosterone is an acceptable surrogate endpoint in hormone sensitive advanced prostate cancer which can be translated into less pain from bone metastases , improvement in urinary flow , and in some cases slowing of tumour progression , although a clear-cut survival benefit has not been demonstrated .
Androgen ablation is considered to be a palliative treatment .
Furthermore , reduction of testosterone to castrate levels has been accepted as a valid surrogate for clinical efficacy in advanced prostate cancer by the CHMP in 2004 as part of scientific advice from the SAWP .
Thus , the documented pharmacological endpoint serum testosterone < 50 ng/ dL , documented for Vantas in studies 302 , 301 and in addition in the Long Term Extension of Study 301 is an acceptable primary efficacy endpoint in patients with advanced prostate cancer .
With an efficacy of 98-100 % in serum testosterone reduction further active comparator studies are redundant and thus not necessary .
Another LHRH agonist could be used , but this is superfluous considering the meta-analysis presented by Applicant , orchidectomy is not acceptable when reversible methods are available , DES is obsolete and non-steroidal anti-androgens may have inferior efficacy when used as monotherapy .
The safety database seems limited , but no unexpected safety issues have occurred nor in the American post marketing surveillance neither in the trials .
The data of the Long Term Extension of Study 301 support long-term safety for patients treated with Vantas for two or more years .
A distinction should be made between safety aspects of androgen suppression therapy in general and the ( local ) safety of this product .
The safety of androgen suppression is well known and further information is not necessary for this product .
The local safety of Vantas is sufficiently investigated and further comparative studies are not necessary .
The proposal of the applicant/ MAH to include five pharmacovigilance safety concerns in the Risk Management Plan is endorsed ( two relate specifically to the unique Vantas formulation while the other three are classified as class effects : expulsions , cellulitis , flare , osteoporosis and QT prolongation ) .
In conclusion , the CHMP agrees that the responses submitted by the Applicant indicate that the issues are resolved .
Vantas is a new LHRH agonist and this pharmacological class was introduced for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer more than 20 years ago .
There is no indication that any of the members within this class differs with respect to efficacy and safety , and Vantas seems to be no exception in that respect .
The data from the Long Term Extension Study 301 concerning efficacy and safety are in support for both long-term efficacy and safety for patients , receiving palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer with histrelin implant for two or more years .
The CHMP requests the inclusion , as proposed by the Applicant/ MAH , of the five pharmacovigilance safety concerns in the Risk Management Plan as mentioned above .
The CHMP has recommended the granting of the Marketing Authorisation for which the Summary of Product Characteristics , labelling and package leaflet are the final versions achieved during the Coordination group procedure as mentioned in Annex III for Vantas .
5 The valid Summary of Product Characteristics , labelling and package leaflet are the final versions achieved during the Coordination group procedure .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Rectangular and blue , engraved with " A-007 " and " 5 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 3 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
5 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
8 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
9 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Rectangular and pink , engraved with " A-008 " and " 10 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 14 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
15 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
16 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
19 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
20 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Tablet Round and yellow , engraved with " A-009 " and " 15 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 25 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
26 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
27 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
30 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
31 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Round and pink , engraved with " A-011 " and " 30 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 36 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
37 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
38 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
41 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
42 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each orodispersible tablet contains 10 mg of aripiprazole .
2 mg aspartame ( E951 ) per orodispersible tablet
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Orodispersible tablet Round and pink , marked with " A " over " 640 " on one side and " 10 " on the other .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
46 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
47 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
48 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
49 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
50 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
52 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
58 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
59 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
60 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
61 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
62 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
64 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Orodispersible tablet Round and pink , marked with " A " over " 643 " on one side and " 30 " on the other .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
70 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
71 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
72 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
73 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
74 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
76 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Oral solution Clear , colourless to light yellow liquid .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
ABILIFY oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day ( i. e.
10 or 15 ml solution/ day ) with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
A calibrated measuring cup and a 2 ml calibrated dropper are included in the carton .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day ( i. e.
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Die empfohlene Anfangsdosis für ABILIFY beträgt 15 mg einmal täglich , unabhängig von den Mahlzeiten als Monotherapie oder Kombinationstherapie ( siehe Abschnitt 5.1 ) . 15 ml solution/ day ) administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
Die maximale Tagesdosis sollte 30 mg nicht überschreiten . 30 ml solution/ day ) .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
82 For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see sections 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
83 Tardive dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
84 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product .
The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reactions ( possibly delayed ) .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance , glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the oral solution .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
85 When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
86 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
Die folgenden unerwünschten Ereignisse wurden während der Post-Marketing Überwachung berichtet.Die Häufigkeit dieser Ereignisse wird als nicht bekannt erachtet ( kann aufgrund der verfügbaren Daten nicht geschätzt werden ) . : The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
88 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N = 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N = 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
98 Lösung zum Einnehmen : Aripiprazole is well absorbed when administered orally as the solution .
At equivalent doses , the peak plasma concentrations of aripiprazole ( Cmax ) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic
90 exposure ( AUC ) was equivalent to tablets .
In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects , the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax values was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
The single- dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were
91 observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Solution for injection Clear , colourless , aqueous solution .
ABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
Treatment with aripiprazole solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically appropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated .
To enhance absorption and minimise variability , injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus maximus muscle , avoiding adipose regions , is recommended .
ABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously .
ABILIFY solution for injection is ready to use and intended for short-term use only ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended initial dose for aripiprazole solution for injection is 9.75 mg ( 1.3 ml ) , administered as a single intramuscular injection .
The effective dose range of aripiprazole solution for injection is 5.25-15 mg as a single injection .
A lower dose of 5.25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given , on the basis of individual clinical status , which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
A second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection , on the basis of individual clinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period .
The maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg ( including all formulations of aripiprazole ) .
If continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole , see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ABILIFY tablets , ABILIFY orodispersible tablets , or ABILIFY oral solution .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to
94 establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients who are 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
The efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has not been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder .
Simultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be associated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression .
If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection , patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension ( see section 4.5 ) .
Patients receiving aripiprazole solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension .
Blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly .
The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication ( either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products ) .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazol sollte mit Vorsicht bei Patienten mit bekannten kardiovaskulären Erkrankungen ( Myokardinfarkt oder ischämische Herzerkrankung , Herzinsuffizienz , Überleitungsstörungen ) , zerebrovaskulären Erkrankungen , Bedingungen , die für Hypotonie prädisponieren ( Dehydratation , Hypovolämie , Behandlung mit blutdrucksenkenden Arzneimitteln ) oder Hypertonie ( einschließlich akzelerierte und maligne Form ) angewendet werden . 95 conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
96 Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
The administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administered concomitantly .
However , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subjects , administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone .
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
97 Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
The administration of aripiprazole solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly .
However , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subjects , administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone .
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Muttermilch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) in clinical trials with aripiprazole solution for injection ( see section 5.1 ) :

Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
99 Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
Agitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with aripiprazole solution for injection :
In two short- term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic patients presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours , aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol .
In one short-term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours , aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam .
The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for lorazepam , and 8.7 for aripiprazole .
In subpopulation analyses on patients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation , a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , oral aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on oral aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for oral haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on oral aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to oral olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole :
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
102 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole solution for injection administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and has an absolute bioavailability of 100 % .
The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations .
In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Administration of aripiprazole solution for injection was well tolerated and produced no direct target organ toxicity in rats or monkeys after repeated dosing at systemic exposures ( AUC ) that were 15 and 5 times , respectively , human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramuscular .
In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies , no new safety concerns were observed at maternal exposures up to 15 ( rat ) and 29 ( rabbit ) times human exposure at 30 mg .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional oral aripiprazole studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose 2 or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .

Abraxane is a powder that is made up into a suspension for infusion ( drip into a vein ) .
It contains the active substance paclitaxel ( 5 mg/ ml ) .
Abraxane is used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first treatment for their metastatic disease has stopped working and for whom standard treatment including an anthracycline ( a type of anticancer medicine ) is not suitable . Metastatic means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body .
Abraxane is used on its own .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
Abraxane should only be given under the supervision of a specialist cancer doctor in wards that are specialised in giving cytotoxic ( cell-killing ) medicines .
The recommended dose is 260 mg per square metre of body surface area ( calculated using the patient s height and weight ) .
It is given over a period of 30 minutes , every three weeks .
The dose may be reduced or treatment interrupted in patients who have certain side effects affecting the blood or the nerves .
Abraxane should not be used in patients who have severe problems with their liver .
The appropriate doses for patients with mild or moderate liver problems or with kidney problems are not known .
The active substance in Abraxane , paclitaxel , belongs to the group of anticancer medicines known as the taxanes .
Paclitaxel blocks the ability of cancer cells to break down their internal skeleton that allows them to divide and multiply .
With their skeleton still in place , the cells cannot divide and they eventually die .
Abraxane also affects non-cancer cells such as blood and nerve cells , which can cause side effects .
Paclitaxel has been available as an anticancer medicine since 1993.
Conventional types of paclitaxel contain substances ( solvents ) that dissolve the paclitaxel , but can cause side effects .

The effects of Abraxane were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans .
The company also presented data from the published literature .
The effectiveness of Abraxane has been studied in one main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , around three-quarters of whom had received an anthracycline in the past .
Around half of the patients in the study had already received treatments for their cancer after it had become metastatic .
The effects of Abraxane ( given on its own ) were compared with those of a conventional paclitaxel- containing medicine ( given together with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients who responded after at least five weeks of treatment .
This was defined as the patient s main tumours having disappeared or having shrunk in size by at least 30 % .
What benefit has Abraxane shown during the studies ?
Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
Overall , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 women receiving Abraxane responded to treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 receiving conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
When looking only at the patients who were receiving their first treatment for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in terms of measures of effectiveness such as the time until the disease got worse and survival .
In contrast , in patients who had taken other treatments for metastatic breast cancer before , these additional measures showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines .
Therefore , the company withdrew its application for the use of Abraxane as first-line treatment during the assessment of the medicine .
The most common side effects with Abraxane ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) are neutropenia ( low levels of neutrophils , a type of white blood cell ) , anaemia ( low red blood cell counts ) , leucopenia ( low levels of leucocytes , a type of white blood cell ) , thrombocytopenia ( low blood platelet counts ) , lymphopenia ( low levels of lymphocytes , a type of white blood cell ) , peripheral neuropathy ( nerve damage in the hands and feet ) , neuropathy ( nerve damage ) , hypoaesthesia ( reduced sense of touch ) , paraesthesia ( unusual sensations like pins and needles ) , nausea ( feeling sick ) , diarrhoea , vomiting , constipation , stomatitis ( inflammation of the lining of the mouth ) , alopecia ( hair loss ) , rash , arthralgia ( joint pain ) , myalgia ( muscle pain ) , anorexia ( loss of appetite ) , fatigue ( tiredness ) , asthenia ( weakness ) and pyrexia ( fever ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abraxane , see the Package Leaflet .
Abraxane should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients .
It should also not be used in patients who are breast feeding or who have low levels of neutrophils in the blood before starting treatment .
The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines in patients whose first treatment had stopped working , and that , unlike other paclitaxel-containing medicines , it does not need other medicines to reduce side effects .
The Committee decided that Abraxane s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated .
The Committee recommended that Abraxane be given marketing authorisation .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Abraxane to Abraxis BioScience Limited on 11 January 2008.

4.2 Indications for use , specifying the target species
As an aid in the management of overweight and obesity in adult dogs .
To be used as part of an overall weight management programme which also includes appropriate dietary changes .
Introducing appropriate lifestyle changes ( e. g. increased exercise ) , in conjunction with this weight management programme , may provide additional benefits .
Do not use in dogs with impaired liver function .
Do not use in case of hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Do not use in dogs during pregnancy and lactation .
Do not use in dogs less than 18 months of age .
Do not use in dogs in which overweight or obesity is caused by a concomitant systemic disease such as hypothyroidism or hyperadrenocorticism .
The use in dogs for breeding purposes has not been evaluated .
If vomiting , significantly reduced appetite or diarrhoea repeatedly occurs , treatment should be interrupted and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought .
Where treatment is interrupted due to vomiting , it is recommended that when treatment is resumed , the product should be administered after a meal .
In addition , treatment should be interrupted and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought where the observed body weight loss is severe and rapid .
Special precautions to be taken by the person administering the veterinary medicinal product to animals
In case of accidental self-administration , seek medical advice immediately and show the package leaflet or the label to the physician .
If accidental eye contact occurs , flush immediately with copious amounts of water .
A decreased appetite may occur during treatment .
This is related to the mode of action of the product and should not be considered as an adverse reaction unless it becomes very significant .
Vomiting , diarrhoea or softened stools may occur during treatment .
In most cases , these effects are mild and transient .
In case an adverse reaction repeatedly occurs or in case the dog stops eating for two consecutive days , treatment should be interrupted and the advice of a veterinarian should be sought .
In laboratory studies , decreases in serum albumin , globulin , total protein , calcium and alkaline phosphatase and increases in ALT and AST were detected following administration of the product at the recommended treatment dose .
Generally , the severity of these effects increased with increasing dose .
Typically , these findings normalised , or appeared to be reversing , within two weeks following the end of treatment .
The following adverse reactions were observed during the clinical trials ( pooled data* ) :
vomiting : repeated ( > 3 x ) diarrhoea / soft stools
* data from 360 dogs over the whole treatment period .
4.7 Use during pregnancy , lactation or lay
Do not use in dogs during pregnancy and lactation .
4.8 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No drug interactions were observed in studies where Yarvitan was administered concomitantly with NSAIDs ( carprofen , meloxicam ) or ACE inhibitors ( enalapril , benazepril ) .
Interactions with other drug types were not specifically investigated .
The absorption of lipid soluble drugs used concomitantly with mitratapide has not been investigated .
Therefore , for dogs receiving treatments in addition to the product , drug interactions should be monitored closely .
3/ 20 4.9 Amounts to be administered and administration route
Administer orally once daily at 0.63 mg mitratapide/ kg bodyweight ( 1 ml of the product per 8 kg ) given for 2 periods of 21 days with 14 days without treatment in between .
In order to allow proper dosing , the dog should be weighed on day 1 and on day 35 ( i. e. at the start of each treatment period ) .
Treatment should be given with food .
Use the dosing pipette as provided with the product .
During the first 21 days of treatment , the quantity of food the animal receives may remain unchanged .
Thereafter , feeding should be in accordance with energy requirements for maintenance ( to be calculated by the veterinarian ) .
This can be achieved either with a regular pet food or with a low calorie ( diet ) pet food .
In clinical trials , treated animals rapidly regained weight following cessation of treatment when diet was not restricted .
In order to avoid this rebound weight gain , it is necessary to continue the feeding for maintenance regimen after the end of treatment with the product .
Mitratapide therapy should be restricted to one treatment course for an individual dog .
4.10 Overdose ( symptoms , emergency procedures , antidotes ) , if necessary
The following clinical signs were observed after 3 or 5 times overdosing in dogs : softened or liquid faeces , vomiting , salivation , anorexia , severe weight loss , emaciated appearance , dehydration and pale mucosae .
In case of accidental overdosing , symptomatic therapy should be administered .
Mitratapide is a potent inhibitor of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTP ) .
Administration of mitratapide to dogs results in reduced uptake of dietary lipids , dose dependent decreases in serum cholesterol and triglyceride and an increased presence of triglyceride containing droplets in enterocytes .
It is assumed that these effects are mediated by MTP inhibition at the level of the enterocyte .
This results in blockage of the uptake of dietary lipids .
Mitratapide also has a slight appetite decreasing effect , which is linked to its mode of action .
Accumulation of triglycerides inside the enterocytes may be followed by decreased appetite .
In clinical trials , the following weight loss percentages were obtained :
Percentages of dogs per weight loss category for mitratapide versus placebo :
25.2 9.5 22.5 8.1 41.7 11.9 47.3 11.6 63.8 31.0 65.1 26.7
* : in line with the recommended treatment schedule
Laboratory animals and dogs rapidly absorb orally administered mitratapide .
The most important metabolic transformation is sulphoxidation , which produces three active metabolites .
Following oral administration , the bioavailability of mitratapide ( parent compound and metabolites ) is in the range from 55 to 69 % , the volume of distribution is approximately 5 l/ kg .
Mitratapide and its metabolites bind very extensively ( > 99 % ) to plasma proteins and distribute to the tissues .
After multiple dosing , the highest concentrations are present in the adrenal glands , liver , jejunum and kidney , but there is no exposure in the brain , excluding any central effect of the product .
Excretion is rapid and mainly via the faeces .
In fed dogs , a single dose of 0.63 mg mitratapide/ kg bodyweight results in maximum concentrations of the parent substance in plasma of on average 0.012 µg/ ml attained 3.5 hours after dosing ; the sulphoxide metabolites reach maximum concentration of on average 0.0136 µg/ ml and 0.0168 µg/ ml , respectively after 6.5 hours and 8.5 hours ; the sulphone metabolite reaches 0.0092 µg/ ml after 17.5 hours .
At the end of a three week dosing period , mitratapide attains average steady-state concentrations of 0.0068 µg/ ml , the sulphoxide metabolites 0.0089 µg/ ml and 0.0167 µg/ ml , respectively , the sulphone 0.0471 µg/ ml .
The terminal plasma half-life is 6.3 hours for mitratapide , 9.8 hours and 11.7 hours for the sulphoxides , respectively , and 44.7 hours for the sulphone metabolite .
The pharmacokinetic parameters display variable dependency on dose and vary slightly between the first and the second three week treatment periods of a complete treatment schedule .

Abraxane 5 mg/ ml powder for suspension for infusion .
After reconstitution , each ml of suspension contains 5 mg of paclitaxel .
Excipients The reconstituted medicinal product contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
The reconstituted suspension has a pH of 6-7.5 and an osmolality of 300-360 mOsm/ kg .
The powder is white to yellow .
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard , anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated ( See also section 4.4 ) .
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in the administration of cytotoxic agents .
The procedure for reconstitution is described in section 6.6 .
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/ m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks .
Patients who experience severe neutropenia ( neutrophil count < 0.50 x 109/ l for a week or longer ) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/ m2 for subsequent courses .
Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy , additional dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/ m2 .
Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil counts recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l.
For grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2 , followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses .
Insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( see sections 4.4 . and 5.2 ) .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel .
Studies in patients with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with renal impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
In the clinical studies , no toxicities occurred notably more frequently among elderly patients who received Abraxane .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who have baseline neutrophil counts < 1.5 x 109/ l.
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel , which may have substantially different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel ( see sections 5.1 and 5.2). .
If hypersensitivity occurs , the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately , symptomatic treatment should be initiated , and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel .
Bone marrow suppression ( primarily neutropenia ) occurs frequently with Abraxane .
Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts should be performed during Abraxane therapy .
Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane until neutrophils recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l and platelets recover to > 100 x 109/ l.
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane , although development of severe symptoms is less common .
The occurrence of grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose reduction .
If grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops , treatment should be withheld until resolution to grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of Abraxane is recommended ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity , particularly from myelosuppression , and such patients should be closely monitored for development of profound myelosuppression .
The use of Abraxane has not been formally studied in patients specifically with hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL/ ALT > 10 x ULN ) should not be treated with Abraxane .
The appropriate dose regimen in patients with less severe hepatic impairment is unknown .
While cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane has not been demonstrated , cardiac events are not uncommon in the indicated population , especially in patients who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease .
Thus patients receiving Abraxane should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events .
Sexually active men and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and up to six months after treatment for men , and one month after treatment for women ( see section 4.6 ) .
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases has not been established .
CNS metastases are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy .
If patients experience nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane , they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents .
When reconstituted , Abraxane contains approximately 425 mg sodium per dose .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed , in part , by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 ( see section 5.2 ) .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit ( e. g. erythromycin , fluoxetine , imidazole antifungals ) or induce ( e. g. rifampicin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , efavirenz , nevirapine ) either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 .
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents .
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy .
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy .
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy , and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception , unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel .
4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane .
Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after treatment .
It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk .
Because of potential serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants , Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation .
Breastfeeding must be discontinued for the duration of therapy .
Abraxane induced infertility in male rats ( see section 5.3 ) .
Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Abraxane may cause side effects such as tiredness ( very common ) and dizziness ( common ) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery .
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or dizzy .
The following are the most common and important incidences of adverse reactions related to 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/ m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study .
Neutropenia was the most notable important haematological toxicity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) , and was rapidly reversible and dose dependent ; leukopenia was reported in 71 % of patients .

Adverse reactions reported with Abraxane at any dose in clinical trials .
Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patients
Cranial nerve palsies , vocal cord paresis , and rare reports of severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported during post-marketing surveillance of Abraxane .
In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine , reports of palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesiae have been reported as part of the continuing surveillance of Abraxane .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events has not been established .
There is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose .
In the event of an overdose , the patient should be closely monitored .
Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities , which are bone marrow suppression , mucositis and peripheral neuropathy .
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation .
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions .
In addition , paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or bundles of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis .
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles .
Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells .
It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor , and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC ( secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine ) .
Data from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer .
In one study , Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/ m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/ m2 as a 30 minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
Patients were treated without steroid pre- treatment or planned G-CSF support .
Cycles were administered at 3 week intervals .
The response rates in all patients were 39.5 % ( 95 % CI :
24.9 % - 54.2 % ) and 47.6 %
35,3 % - 60,0 % ) . 35.3 % - 60.0 % ) , respectively .
The median time to disease progression was 5.3 months ( 175 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
4.6 6.2 months ) and 6.1 months ( 300 mg/ m2 ; 95 % CI :
This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who were treated every 3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel , either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity ( N = 225 ) , or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication ( N = 229 ) .
Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status ( ECOG 1 or 2 ) at study entry ; 79 % had visceral metastases ; and 76 % had > 3 sites of metastases .
Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy ; 27 % had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only , 40 % in the metastatic setting only , and 19 % in both metastatic and adjuvant settings .
Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal product as second or greater than second-line therapy .
Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines .
Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression , and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy , are shown below .

CA012-0 Addendum dated Final ( 23 March-2005 ) a Chi-squared test b Log-rank test
9 229 patients treated with Abraxane in the randomized , controlled clinical trial were evaluated for safety .
Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade for patients experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy .
The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown .
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies .
The drug exposure ( AUC ) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng . hr/ ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m2 .
Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m2 , paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner .
The mean Cmax of paclitaxel , which occurred at the end of the infusion , was 18.7 µg/ ml .
The mean total clearance was 15 l/ hr/ m2 .
The mean volume of distribution was 632 l/ m2 ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel .
In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those following 175 mg/ m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours .
The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger ( 43 % ) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher ( 53 % ) .
Differences in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose reflected differences in total dose and rate of infusion .
There were no differences in terminal half-lives .
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 90 % .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins , using paclitaxel at concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1.2 µM , indicate that about 87 % of paclitaxel is bound ; the presence of ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .
Based on the published literature , in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel ; and to two minor metabolites , 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6 -3 -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel .
The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites is catalysed by CYP2C8 , -3A4 , and both -2C8 and -3A4 respectively .
The effect of renal or hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been formally investigated .
In patients with metastatic breast cancer , after a 30 minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m2 , the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4 % of the total administered dose with less than 1 % as the metabolites 6 -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 -p-hydroxypaclitaxel , indicating extensive non-renal clearance .
Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion .
Pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in patients aged over 65 years seems comparable to that in patients less than 65 years .
However , little information in patients over 75 years is available as only 3 patients over 75 years of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis .
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied .
However , based on the published literature , paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses , based upon its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
Paclitaxel has been shown to be genotoxic in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) , but it did not induce mutagenicity
10 in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/ hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( CHO/ HGPRT ) gene mutation assay .
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility and foetal toxicity in rats .

6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling
Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and , as with other potentially toxic compounds , caution should be exercised in handling Abraxane .
The use of gloves , goggles and protective clothing is recommended .
If the suspension contacts the skin , the skin should be washed immediately and thoroughly with soap and water .
If it contacts mucous membranes , the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with water .
Abraxane should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the handling of cytotoxic agents .
Abraxane is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use .
After reconstitution , each ml of suspension contains 5 mg of paclitaxel .
Using a sterile syringe , 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml ( 0.9 % ) solution for infusion should slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute .
The solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial .
The solution should not be injected directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming .
Once the addition is complete , the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure proper wetting of the solid .
Then , the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/ or inverted for at least 2 minutes until complete resuspension of any powder occurs .
If foaming or clumping occurs , the solution must stand for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides .
The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates .
If precipitates or settling are visible , the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete resuspension prior to use .
Some settling of the reconstituted suspension may occur .
Complete resuspension should be ensured by mild agitation before use .
Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitates are observed .
Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ ml suspension required for the patient and inject the appropriate amount of reconstituted Abraxane into an empty , sterile , PVC or non-PVC type intravenous bag .
The use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration sets is not necessary to prepare or administer Abraxane infusions .
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
2 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
4 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
5 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
6 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
8 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
9 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
11 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
13 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
18 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
19 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
20 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .

Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
22 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
23 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
25 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
26 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
27 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
32 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
33 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
34 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
36 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
37 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
39 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
40 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
41 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
46 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
47 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
48 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
50 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
51 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
53 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
54 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
55 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
60 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
61 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
62 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
64 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
65 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
67 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
68 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
69 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
74 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
75 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
76 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
78 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
79 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
81 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
82 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
83 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
88 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
89 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
90 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
92 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
93 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
95 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
96 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
97 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
102 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
103 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
104 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
106 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
107 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
109 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
110 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
111 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
116 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
117 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
118 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
120 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
121 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
123 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
124 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
125 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Weight ( kg )
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
130 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
131 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase 40,000/ µl or Hb increase 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route .
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
132 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
134 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
135 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
137 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
138 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
139 18 hours postdose .
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

What Abseamed is and what it is used for 2.
Before you use Abseamed 3.
WHAT ABSEAMED IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Abseamed contains a hormone called epoetin alfa , which stimulates the production of red blood cells .
Epoetin alfa is produced by a specialised genetic technology and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin .
Abseamed is used : for treating symptomatic anaemia associated with kidney disease ( given by injection into a vein ) in children and adults on dialysis in adults on peritoneal dialysis for treating severe symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease in adults not yet undergoing dialysis ( given by injection into a vein ) for treating anaemia and reducing the need for a blood transfusion in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the doctor in moderately anaemic patients who are going to have surgery and prior to it , donate blood so that their own blood can be given to them during or after surgery ( autologous predonation ) as an alternative to a blood transfusion in adult patients about to undergo major orthopaedic ( bone ) surgery where there is a potentially high risk from blood transfusion complications
BEFORE YOU USE ABSEAMED
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of Abseamed
- if you have developed Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( reduced or stopped production of red blood cells )
following treatment with any erythropoietin
- if you have high blood pressure which is not properly controlled
- if you are donating your own blood before surgery , and :
you had a heart attack or stroke in the month before your treatment you have unstable angina pectoris ( new or increasing chest pain ) you are at risk of blood clots in the veins ( deep venous thrombosis ) for example , if you have had clots before
- if you cannot receive adequate treatment for the prevention of blood clots ( antithrombotic
- if you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery and :
you have severe disorders of blood circulation of the heart ( coronary heart disease ) , arteries of the legs or arms ( peripheral arterial occlusive disease ) , neck vessels ( vascular disease of the carotids ) or the brain ( cerebrovascular disease ) you had a recent heart attack or stroke
If any of these applies to you , or might apply , tell your doctor at once .
Take special care with Abseamed :
In all patients treated with Abseamed blood pressure should be closely monitored and treated , if necessary .
Abseamed should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated or poorly controllable hypertension .
It may be necessary to initiate or increase treatment against high blood pressure .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , Abseamed treatment should be discontinued .
Take special care with Abseamed if you have epilepsy or chronic liver disease .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent increase in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with Abseamed , which gradually regresses during the course of continued therapy .
Your doctor may do regular blood tests to check your blood platelet count during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia , e. g. iron deficiency , damage of red blood cells ( haemolysis ) , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be taken into account and treated prior to initiating therapy with Abseamed .
In order to ensure optimum response to Abseamed adequate iron stores should be ensured .
Your doctor may do blood tests to decide , if you need iron supplements .
Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of subcutaneous ( injection under the skin ) erythropoietin treatment .
PRCA means the inability to produce enough red blood cells in the bone marrow .
PRCA can result in sudden and severe anaemia , the symptoms of which are unusual tiredness , feeling dizzy or breathlessness .
If you experience these symptoms you should talk to your doctor at once .
Your doctor can decide whether Abseamed is not working properly for you .
If you develop PRCA your Abseamed therapy will be discontinued and your doctor will decide how best to treat your anaemia .
There is not much experience with subcutaneous use ( injection into the skin ) of Abseamed in kidney patients .
Therefore , if you are being treated for anaemia associated with kidney disease , Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein ( intravenously ) .
Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) regularly
- to ensure that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level as high haemoglobin could put
you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of death
- to minimise the risk of an increase in blood pressure .
Increased levels of potassium ( hyperkalaemia ) have been observed in isolated cases .
The correction of your anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and thus increased potassium and protein intake .
Therefore dialysis procedures may have to be adjusted to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored .
If an elevated or increasing serum potassium level is detected , your doctor may consider to discontinue the treatment with Abseamed until the potassium level has returned to the normal range .
An increase in dose of a particular blood-thinning medicine ( heparin ) during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with Abseamed .
Inadequate thinning of the blood by heparin ( heparinisation ) may lead to occlusion of the dialysis system .
If you have chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or signs of congestion due to inadequate heart output , your doctor will make sure that your haemoglobin levels do not exceed a certain level .
Based on information available to date , treatment of anaemia with Abseamed in adult patients with chronic kidney failure ( renal insufficiency ) who do not yet require dialysis , does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
The 2-3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of desired effects should be taken into account when assessing the efficacy of Abseamed .
Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) regularly and adjust your dose of Abseamed accordingly to minimise the risk of blood clotting ( thrombotic events ) .
Cancer patients receiving treatment with erythropoietin have an increased risk of blood clots/ blood clotting disorders ( thrombotic vascular events ) .
This risk should be carefully weighted against the benefit to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa , particularly if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , e. g. if you are obese or have a history of thrombotic vascular events ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Abseamed may act as a blood cell growth factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer .
Depending on your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable .
Your doctor will consider warnings and precautions associated with autologous blood predonation , especially volume replacement .
Patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery
If you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery , the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of Abseamed treatment .
Blood clots ( thrombotic events ) can be a
Ihr Arzt wird dieses Risiko sorgfältig gegenüber den aus der Behandlung mit Epoetin alfa abgeleiteten Vorteilen abwägen . Your doctor will weight this risk carefully against the benefits to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa .
You should receive adequate measures in order to prevent blood clots ( thrombotic prophylaxis ) , particularly if you have cardiovascular disorders .
If your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) are too high you should not receive Abseamed , since you have an increased risk of blood clotting after the surgery .
If you are a cancer patient be aware that erythropoietins may act as growth factor .
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
If you are taking cyclosporin ( medicine to suppress your immune system ) during therapy with Abseamed , your doctor may order special blood tests to measure cyclosporin levels .
Laboratory tests did not show an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF ( G-CSF and GM-CSF are medicines to stimulate the immune-system e. g. when receiving a chemotherapy for cancer or in case of HIV ) .
There is not much experience with Abseamed in pregnant women or women who are breast-feeding .
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
No effects on ability to drive or use machines have been observed .

192 Adult patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery
The recommended dose of 600 International Units ( IU ) per kilogram bodyweight is given weekly for three weeks before surgery and on the day of surgery .
This is given by injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
In cases where there is a need to shorten the time for treatment before the operation is carried out , a dose of 300 IU/ kg is given on each of the next ten days before surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately afterwards .
If blood tests in the period before the operation show your haemoglobin level to be too high , the treatment will be stopped .
It is important that levels of iron in your blood are normal throughout Abseamed treatment .
Where appropriate you will receive oral doses of iron , ideally starting before the Abseamed treatment begins .
If you are a kidney patient Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein .
Do not give by injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
The amount injected in any one place should not normally exceed one mililitre ( 1 ml ) .
The injections are given preferably in the thigh or the front part of the abdominal wall .
At the start of your therapy , Abseamed may be injected by medical staff .
However , your doctor may decide that it is right for you to learn how to inject Abseamed under the skin yourself .
You will receive appropriate training for you to do this .
Under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself unless you have been trained to do so .
Remove one syringe from the pack and remove the protective cap from the injection needle .
Clean the skin at the injection site using an alcohol wipe .
Form a skin fold by pinching the skin between thumb and forefinger .
Insert the needle into the skin fold with a quick , firm action .
Ensure that you only inject the amount as instructed by your doctor or nurse .
Withdraw the needle quickly and apply pressure over the injection site with a dry , sterile pad .
Discard any remaining liquid .
Only use each syringe for one injection .
If you inject more Abseamed than you should
You should inform the doctor immediately if you think too much Abseamed has been injected .
If you have missed an injection , or injected too little , talk to your doctor .
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose .
If you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
Like all medicines , Abseamed can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
If you experience headaches , particularly sudden , stabbing migraine-like headaches or feel confused or have fits , tell your doctor immediately .
These may be the warning signs of a sudden rise in blood pressure which requires urgent treatment .
- flu-like symptoms , such as headache , aches and pains in the joints , feeling of weakness ,
These may be more common at the start of treatment .
- An increase in levels of blood platelets ( thrombocytes ) which are normally involved in the
- Thrombotic events ( blood clotting ) in blood vessels , such as disturbed blood perfusion of the
heart , heart attack , cerebral haemorrhages , stroke , temporary disturbance of blood perfusion in the brain , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , dilatation of the wall of a blood vessel ( aneurysm ) , retinal thrombosis , and blood clot in an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietin treatment .
- Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in rare cases , including swelling , mainly in the
region of the eyelids and the lips ( Quincke 's oedema ) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms of tingling , reddening , itching , hot flush and accelerated pulse .
- Pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of
subcutaneous ( injection under the skin ) erythropoietin treatment .
PRCA means the inability to produce enough red blood cells in the bone ( see section Take special care with Abseamed ) .
- raised blood pressure which may require treatment with medicinal products or adjustment of the
dosage of medicinal products you already take for high blood pressure .
Your doctor may monitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Abseamed , particularly at the start of therapy .
- Occlusion in the connection between artery and vein ( shunt thrombosis ) may occur especially if
you have low blood pressure or if your arteriovenous fistula has complications .
Your doctor may check your shunt and prescribe a medicinal product to prevent thrombosis .
- blood clotting ( thrombotic vascular events ) ( see section Take special care with Abseamed ) .
Therefore your haemoglobin-levels and your blood pressure should
with underlying cardiovascular disease : after donating blood repeatedly vascular and thrombotic events ( blood clotting ) can occur independently of treatment with Abseamed .
Therefore your doctor may prescribe a medicinal product for volume replacement ( infusion ) .
Patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery
Treatment with Abseamed may be associated with an increased risk of blood clotting after the surgery ( postoperative thrombotic/ vascular disorders ) if your levels of the red blood pigment are too high .

Aclasta is a solution for infusion ( drip into a vein ) containing the active substance zoledronic acid ( 5 mg/ 100 ml ) .
Aclasta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : osteoporosis ( a disease that makes bones fragile ) , both in women who have been through the menopause and in men .
It is used in patients who are at risk of fracture ( bone breaks ) , including patients who have recently broken their hip in a minor trauma , such as a fall ; Paget s disease of the bone , a disease where the normal process of bone growth is changed .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
Aclasta is given as a 100 ml infusion , lasting at least 15 minutes .
This can be repeated once a year in patients being treated for osteoporosis .
Patients who have broken their hip should receive Aclasta at least two weeks after the operation to repair the fracture .
For Paget s disease , only one infusion of Aclasta is given .
The effect of the infusion lasts for a year or more .
Patients must have adequate fluids before and after treatment .
Adequate supplements of vitamin D and calcium are also recommended for all patients receiving Aclasta .
In addition , patients with Paget s disease should take at least 500 mg calcium twice a day for at least 10 days following treatment , and patients who have broken their hip should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125,000 international units ) by mouth or by injection into a muscle before their first infusion .
Using paracetamol or ibuprofen ( anti-inflammation medicines ) shortly after Aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu-like symptoms , joint pain and headache in the three days following the infusion .
Aclasta is not recommended for use in patients who have severe problems with their kidneys .
In the treatment of Paget s disease of the bone , Aclasta must only be used by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of the disease .

In Paget s disease the bone breaks down more quickly , and when it grows back , it is weaker than normal .
The active substance in Aclasta , zoledronic acid , is a bisphosphonate .
It stops the action of the osteoclasts , the cells in the body that are involved in breaking down the bone tissue .
This leads to less bone loss in osteoporosis and less disease activity in Paget s disease .
Because the active substance in Aclasta is the same as the active substance in Zometa , some of the data presented for Zometa were taken into account when assessing Aclasta .
For the treatment of osteoporosis , the effects of Aclasta given once a year have been compared with those of placebo ( a dummy treatment ) in two main studies .
The first involved almost 8,000 elderly women with osteoporosis , looking at the number of spine and hip fractures over three years .
The second involved 2,127 men and women with osteoporosis who were aged over 50 years and had recently broken their hip , and looked at the number of fractures over up to five years .
In both studies , the patients were allowed to take other medicines for osteoporosis , but not other bisphosphonates .
In Paget s disease , Aclasta has been studied in a total of 357 patients in two studies , where it was compared with risedronate ( another bisphosphonate ) over six months .
The patients received one infusion of Aclasta or they received risedronate once a day for two months .
The main measure of effectiveness was whether blood levels of serum alkaline phosphatase ( an enzyme involved in the breakdown of bone ) returned to normal or fell by at least 75 % of the way back to normal levels .
What benefit has Aclasta shown during the studies ?
In osteoporosis , Aclasta was more effective than placebo at reducing the number of fractures .
In the study of elderly women , the risk of spine fractures was reduced by 70 % in patients taking Aclasta ( without any other medicines for osteoporosis ) over three years , compared with those taking placebo .
There was a 41 % risk reduction in hip fractures , when comparing all women taking Aclasta ( with or without other osteoporosis medicines ) with those taking placebo .
In the study of men and women who had broken their hip , 9 % of the patients receiving Aclasta had a fracture ( 92 out of 1,065 ) , compared with 13 % of the patients receiving placebo ( 139 out of 1,062 ) .
This represents a 35 % reduction in the risk of fracture in patients receiving Aclasta .
In Paget s disease , Aclasta was more effective than risedronate .
After six months , the proportion of patients who had responded to treatment was 95 % in one study and 97 % in the other , compared with 75 % and 73 % of the patients who received risedronate .
Most side effects with Aclasta tend to occur within the first three days after infusion , becoming less common with repeated infusions .
The most common side effect with Aclasta ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) is fever .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Aclasta , see the Package Leaflet .
Aclasta should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to zoledronic acid , to other bisphosphonates or to any of the other ingredients .
Aclasta should not be used in patients with hypocalcaemia ( low blood calcium levels ) or in pregnant or breast-feeding women .
As with all bisphosphonates , patients taking Aclasta may also be at risk of kidney problems , reactions at the site of infusion and osteonecrosis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel ( CHMP ) gelangte zu dem Schluss , dass die Vorteile von Aclasta bei der Behandlung der Osteoporose bei Frauen nach den Wechseljahren und bei Männern mit einem erhöhten Risiko für Frakturen , einschließlich mit einer kürzlich erlittenen geringtraumatischen Hüftfraktur , und zur Behandlung von Morbus Paget des Knochens gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen , und empfahl , die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von Aclasta zu erteilen . The Committee recommended that Aclasta be given marketing authorisation .
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Aclasta ?
The company that makes Aclasta will provide educational packs for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for osteoporosis , reminding them how the medicine should be used , and similar packs for patients , which explain the medicine s side effects and when they should contact their doctor .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aclasta to Novartis Europharm Limited on 15 April 2005.

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women in men at increased risk of fracture , including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture .
Treatment of Paget s disease of the bone .
For the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men , the recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta administered once a year .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair ( see section 5.1 ) .
For the treatment of Paget s disease , Aclasta should be prescribed only by physicians with experience in treatment of Paget s disease of the bone .
The recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta .
Retreatment of Paget s disease : specific retreatment data are not available .
After a single treatment with Aclasta in Paget s disease , an extended remission period is observed in responding patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
Aclasta ( 5 mg in 100 ml ready-to-infuse solution ) is administered via a vented infusion line and given at a constant infusion rate .
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes .
For information on the infusion of Aclasta , see section 6.6 .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta .
This is especially important for the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
2 Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget s disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.4 ) .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion .
The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration .
Patients with renal impairment ( see section 4.4 ) Use of Aclasta in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min is not recommended due to limited clinical experience in this population .
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 35 ml/ min .
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required ( see section 5.2 ) .
Elderly patients ( 65 years ) No dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability , distribution and elimination were similar in elderly patients and younger subjects .
Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates .
Aclasta is contraindicated for patients with hypocalcaemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Aclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women ( see section 4.6 ) .
The dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minutes .
Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min ) due to limited clinical experience in this population .
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta .
This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) , see section 4.5 .
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta ( see section 4.3 ) .
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated ( e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve , intestinal calcium malabsorption ) .
Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients .
3 Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget s disease of the bone .
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover , transient hypocalcaemia , sometimes symptomatic , may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta ( see section 4.8 ) .
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget 's disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk .
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease .
Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone , joint and/ or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates , including Aclasta .
Aclasta contains the same active substance found in Zometa ( zoledronic acid ) , used for oncology indications , and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with Aclasta .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported predominantly in patients with cancer receiving treatment regimens including bisphosphonates , including zoledronic acid .
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids .
The majority of reported cases have been associated with dental procedures such as tooth extraction .
Many had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis .
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors ( e. g. cancer , chemotherapy , corticosteroids , poor oral hygiene ) .
While on treatment , these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible .
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy , dental surgery may exacerbate the condition .
For patients requiring dental procedures , there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw .
The clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Specific drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with zoledronic acid .
Zoledronic acid is not systemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro ( see section 5.2 ) .
Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 43-55 % bound ) and interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are therefore unlikely .
Zoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) .
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women .
Studies in animals with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicological effects including malformations ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human breast milk .
Aclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women ( see section 4.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
The overall percentage of patients who experienced post-dose symptoms were 44.7 % , 16.7 % and 10.2 % after the first , second and third infusion , respectively .
Incidence of individual symptoms following the first infusion was : fever ( 17.1 % ) , myalgia ( 7.8 % ) , flu-like symptoms ( 6.7 % ) , arthralgia ( 4.8 % ) and headache ( 5.1 % ) .
The incidence of these symptoms decreased markedly with subsequent doses of Aclasta .
The majority of these symptoms occur within the first three days following Aclasta administration .
The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate and resolved within three days of the event onset .
The percentage of patients who experienced post-dose symptoms was lower in a smaller study ( 19.5 % , 10.4 % , 10.7 % after the first , second and third infusion , respectively ) , where prophylaxis against post-dose symptoms was used as described below .
The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
In the HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial [ PFT ] ( see section 5.1 ) , the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5 % ( 96 out of 3,862 ) and 1.9 % ( 75 out of 3,852 ) in patients receiving Aclasta and placebo , respectively .
The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Aclasta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 out of 3,862 ) compared with patients receiving placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 out of 3,852 ) .
The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is unknown .
In the osteoporosis trials ( PFT , HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [ RFT ] ) the pooled atrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between Aclasta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
For atrial fibrillation serious adverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3 % for Aclasta and 0.8 % for placebo .
Very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 , < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 , < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 , < 1/ 1,000 ) adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 1.
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .

* Additional adverse events which were reported in the individual studies but were not included due to the pooled presentation are :
Uncommon : dysgeusia , oesophagitis , toothache . Common in Paget s disease only .
For hypocalcaemia , see also text below . ** Based on post-marketing reports .
Since these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product .
Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal dysfunction manifested as deterioration in renal function ( i. e. increased serum creatinine ) and in rare cases acute renal failure .
Renal dysfunction has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid , especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or additional risk factors ( e. g oncology patients with chemotherapy , concomitant nephrotoxic medications , severe dehydration ) , the majority of whom received a 4 mg dose every 3 4 weeks , but it has been observed in patients after a single administration .
In clinical trials in osteoporosis , the change in creatinine clearance ( measured annually prior to dosing ) and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Aclasta and placebo treatment groups over three years .
There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within 10 days in 1.8 % of Aclasta-treated patients versus 0.8 % of placebo-treated patients .
Hypocalcaemia In clinical trials in osteoporosis , approximately 0.2 % of patients had notable declines of serum calcium levels ( less than 1.87 mmol/ l ) following Aclasta administration .
No symptomatic cases of hypocalcaemia were observed .
In the Paget s disease trials , symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1 % of patients , in all of whom it resolved .
Based on laboratory assessment , transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference range ( less than 2.10 mmol/ l ) occurred in 2.3 % of Aclasta-treated patients in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of Aclasta-treated patients in the Paget s disease trials .
The frequency of hypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions .
All patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal osteoporosis trial , the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial , and the Paget s disease trials ( see also section 4.2 ) .
In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip fracture , vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading dose of vitamin D prior to Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
Local reactions In a large clinical trial , local reactions at the infusion site , such as redness , swelling and/ or pain , were reported ( 0.7 % ) following the administration of zoledronic acid .
6 Osteonecrosis of the jaw Uncommonly , cases of osteonecrosis ( primarily of the jaw ) have been reported , predominantly in cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates , including zoledronic acid .
Many of these patients had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental surgeries .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has multiple well documented risk factors including a diagnosis of cancer , concomitant therapies ( e. g. chemotherapy , radiotherapy , corticosteroids ) and co-morbid conditions ( e. g. anaemia , coagulopathies , infection , pre- existing dental disease ) .
Although causality has not been determined , it is prudent to avoid dental surgery as recovery may be prolonged ( see section 4.4 ) .
In a large clinical trial in 7,736 patients , osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with Aclasta and one patient treated with placebo .
There is no experience of acute intoxication with Aclasta .
Patients who have received doses higher than those recommended should be carefully monitored .
In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant hypocalcaemia , reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/ or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate .
Mechanism of action Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone .
It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption .
Pharmacodynamic effects Aclasta treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover from elevated post-menopausal levels with the nadir for resorption markers observed at 7 days , and for formation markers at 12 weeks .
Thereafter bone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range .
There was no progressive reduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated in post-menopausal women ( 7,736 women aged 65 89 years ) with either : a femoral neck bone mineral density ( BMD ) with a T-score 1.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral fracture(s ) ; or a femoral neck BMD T-score 2.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral fracture(s ) .
Women who were evaluated for the incidence of vertebral fractures did not receive concomitant osteoporosis therapy , which was allowed for women contributing to the hip and all clinical fracture evaluations .
Concomitant osteoporosis therapy included : calcitonin , raloxifene , tamoxifen , hormone replacement therapy , tibolone ; but excluded other bisphosphonates .
All women received 1,000 to 1,500 mg elemental calcium and 400 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplements daily .
Effect on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta significantly decreased the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures over three years and as early as the one year timepoint ( see Table 2 ) .
Summary of vertebral fracture efficacy at 12 , 24 and 36 months
Aclasta Placebo Absolute reduction in ( % ) ( % ) fracture incidence % ( CI )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 1 year )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 2 year )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 3 year ) ** p < 0.0001
Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older exhibited a 60 % reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Effect on hip fractures Aclasta demonstrated a consistent effect over 3 years , resulting in a 41 % reduction in the risk of hip fractures ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
The hip fracture event rate was 1.44 % for Aclasta-treated patients compared to 2.49 % for placebo-treated patients .
The risk reduction was 51 % in bisphosphonate-naïve patients and 42 % in patients allowed to take concomitant osteoporosis therapy .

Treatment with Aclasta resulted in a 6.7 % increase in BMD at the lumbar spine , 6.0 % at the total hip , 5.1 % at the femoral neck , and 3.2 % at the distal radius over 3 years as compared to placebo .
Bone histology Bone biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest 1 year after the third annual dose in 152 post- menopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with Aclasta ( N=82 ) or placebo ( N=70 ) .
Histomorphometric analysis showed a 63 % reduction in bone turnover .
In patients treated with Aclasta , no osteomalacia , marrow fibrosis or woven bone formation was detected .
Tetrazyklin-Markierungen wurden bei allen außer einer von 82 Biopsien gefunden . Microcomputed
8 tomography ( CT ) analysis demonstrated increased trabecular bone volume and preservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo .
Bone turnover markers Bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( BSAP ) , serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen ( P1NP ) and serum beta-C-telopeptides ( b-CTx ) were evaluated in subsets ranging from 517 to 1,246 patients at periodic intervals throughout the study .
Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30 % relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
P1NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 52 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61 % below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 55 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
During this entire time period bone turnover markers were within the pre-menopausal range at the end of each year .
Repeat dosing did not lead to further reduction of bone turnover markers .
Effect on height In the three-year osteoporosis study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer .
The Aclasta group revealed approximately 2.5 mm less height loss compared to placebo ( 95 % CI :
1.6 mm , 3.5 mm ) [ p < 0.0001 ] .
Days of disability Aclasta significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to back pain by 17.9 days and 11.3 days respectively compared to placebo and significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to fractures by 2.9 days and 0.5 days respectively compared to placebo ( all p < 0.01 ) .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at increased risk of fracture after a recent hip fracture ( RFT ) The incidence of clinical fractures , including vertebral , non-vertebral and hip fractures , was evaluated in 2,127 men and women aged 50-95 years ( mean age 74.5 years ) with a recent ( within 90 days ) low- trauma hip fracture who were followed for an average of 2 years on study medication .
Approximately 42 % of patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score below -2.5 and approximately 45 % of the patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score above -2.5 .
Aclasta was administered once a year , until at least 211 patients in the study population had confirmed clinical fractures .
Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125,000 IU orally or via the intramuscular route ) was given to the majority of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion .
All participants received 1,000 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day .
Ninety-five percent of the patients received their infusion two or more weeks after the hip fracture repair and the median timing of infusion was approximately six weeks after the hip fracture repair .
The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of clinical fractures over the duration of the study .
Effect on all clinical fractures The incidence rates of key clinical fracture variables are presented in Table 4.

( 1 ) Excluding finger , toe and facial fractures ( 2 ) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures
The study was not designed to measure significant differences in hip fracture , but a trend was seen towards reduction in new hip fractures .
All cause mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the Aclasta-treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
This corresponds to a 28 % reduction in the risk of all cause mortality ( p=0.01 ) .
The incidence of delayed hip fracture healing was comparable between Aclasta ( 34 [ 3.2 % ] ) and placebo ( 29 [ 2.7 % ] ) .
Effect on bone mineral density ( BMD ) In the HORIZON-RFT study Aclasta treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip and femoral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints .
Treatment with Aclasta resulted in an increase in BMD of 5.4 % at the total hip and 4.3 % at the femoral neck over 24 months as compared to placebo .
Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised into the study and 185 patients had BMD assessed at 24 months .
At 24 months a similar significant increase of 3.6 % in total hip BMD was observed for patients treated with Aclasta as compared to the effects observed in post-menopausal women in the HORIZON-PFT study .
The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men ; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5 % in men treated with Aclasta versus 8.7 % for placebo .
In another study in men ( study CZOL446M2308 ) an annual infusion of Aclasta was non-inferior to weekly alendronate for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 24 relative to baseline .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget s disease of the bone Aclasta was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to moderate Paget s disease of the bone ( median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6 3.0 times the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry ) confirmed by radiographic evidence .
The efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for 2 months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials .
After 6 months , Aclasta showed 96 % ( 169/ 176 ) and 89 % ( 156/ 176 ) response and serum alkaline phosphatase ( SAP ) normalisation rates compared to 74 % ( 127/ 171 ) and 58 % ( 99/ 171 ) for risedronate ( all p < 0.001 ) .
In the pooled results , a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to baseline were observed over 6 months for Aclasta and risedronate .
10 Patients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter an extended follow-up period .
Of the 143 Aclasta-treated patients and 107 risedronate-treated patients who entered an extended observation study , after a median duration of follow-up of 18 months from time of dosing , 141 Aclasta-treated patients maintained their therapeutic response compared to 71 risedronate-treated patients .
This corresponds to a 96 % reduction of risk of relapse in Aclasta versus risedronate-treated patients .
Bone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget s disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg zoledronic acid .
Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired bone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects .
These results were consistent with biochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover .
Single and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data , which were found to be dose independent .
After initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion , plasma concentrations of the active substance increased rapidly , achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period , followed by a rapid decline to < 10 % of peak after 4 hours and < 1 % of peak after 24 hours , with a subsequent prolonged period of very low concentrations not exceeding 0.1 % of peak levels .
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process : rapid biphasic disappearance from the systemic circulation , with half-lives of t½ 0.24 and t½ 1.87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½ 146 hours .
There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days.
The early disposition phases ( and , with t½ values above ) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and excretion via the kidneys .
Zoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney .
Over the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is recovered in the urine , while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue .
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney .
The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/ h , independent of dose , and unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
The inter- and intra-subject variation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36 % and 34 % , respectively .
Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30 % decrease in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve .
No specific drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with zoledronic acid .
Since zoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity as a direct- acting and/ or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes , zoledronic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems .
Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 43-55 % bound ) and binding is concentration independent .
Therefore , interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are unlikely .
Special populations ( see section 4.2 ) The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance , renal clearance representing 75 ± 33 % of the creatinine clearance , which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/ min ( range 22 to 143 ml/ min ) in the 64 patients studied .
Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr ) , by about 30 % to 40 % in mild to moderate renal impairment , compared to a patient with normal renal function , and lack of accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function , suggest that dose adjustments of zoledronic acid in mild ( Clcr = 50 80 ml/ min ) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/ min are not necessary .
As only limited data are available in severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min ) , no dosing recommendations are possible for this population .
Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/ kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/ kg in rats .
In the single-dose dog infusion studies , 1.0 mg/ kg ( 6 fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure based on AUC ) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects .
Subchronic and chronic toxicity In the intravenous infusion studies , renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when given 0.6 mg/ kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals , six times in total ( for a cumulative dose that corresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure ) while five 15-minute infusions of 0.25 mg/ kg administered at 2 3-week intervals ( a cumulative dose that corresponded to 7 times the human therapeutic exposure ) were well tolerated in dogs .
In the intravenous bolus studies , the doses that were well-tolerated decreased with increasing study duration :
0.2 and 0.02 mg/ kg daily was well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs , respectively but only 0.01 mg/ kg and 0.005 mg/ kg in rats and dogs , respectively , when given for 52 weeks .
Longer-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum intended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs , including the gastrointestinal tract and liver , and at the site of intravenous administration .
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown .
The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses , a finding that reflected the compound s pharmacological antiresorptive activity .
Reproduction toxicity Teratology studies were performed in two species , both via subcutaneous administration .
Teratogenicity was observed in rats at doses 0.2 mg/ kg and was manifested by external , visceral and skeletal malformations .
Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose ( 0.01 mg/ kg body weight ) tested in rats .
No teratological or embryo/ foetal effects were observed in rabbits , although maternal toxicity was marked at 0.1 mg/ kg due to decreased serum calcium levels .
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential .

Aclasta must not be mixed or given intravenously with any other medicinal products .

- If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet ,
please tell your doctor , pharmacist or nurse .
What Aclasta is and what it is used for 2.
Before you are given Aclasta 3.
WHAT ACLASTA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Aclasta is given as a single infusion into a vein by a doctor or nurse .
It belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women , osteoporosis in men and Paget s disease of the bone .
Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in women after the menopause , but can also occur in men .
At the menopause , a woman s ovaries stop producing the female hormone oestrogen , which helps keep bones healthy .
Following the menopause bone loss occurs , bones become weaker and break more easily .
Many patients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because osteoporosis has made their bones weaker .
Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones , mainly oestrogens converted from androgens , also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men .
In both women and men , Aclasta strengthens the bone and therefore makes it less likely to break .
Because Aclasta works for a long time , you will not need another dose of Aclasta for a year .
Paget s disease of the bone It is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material .
In Paget s disease , bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered fashion , which makes it weaker than normal .
If the disease is not treated , bones may become deformed and painful , and may break .
Aclasta works by returning the bone remodelling process to normal , securing formation of normal bone , thus restoring strength to the bone .
BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN ACLASTA
Follow all instructions given to you by your doctor carefully before you are given Aclasta .
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to zoledronic acid , other bisphosphonates or any of the other
- if you have hypocalcaemia ( this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low ) .
- if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant .
26 Take special care with Aclasta Tell your doctor before you are given Aclasta :
- if you are being treated with Zometa , which contains the same active substance as Aclasta .
- if you have a kidney problem , or used to have one .
- if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements .
- if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed .
- if you have had sections of your intestine removed .
- if you had or have pain , swelling or numbness of the jaw or a loosening of the tooth .
If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery , tell your dentist that you are being treated with Aclasta .
Aclasta is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age .
The use of Aclasta in children and adolescents has not been studied .
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor , pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking any medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys .
Using Aclasta with food and drink Make sure you drink enough fluids ( at least one or two glasses ) before and after the treatment with Aclasta , as directed by your doctor .
This will help to prevent dehydration .
You may eat normally on the day you are treated with Aclasta .
Elderly patients ( age 65 years and over ) Aclasta can be given to older patients .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding You should not be given Aclasta if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant .
You should not be given Aclasta if you are breast-feeding .
Ask your doctor , pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine .
Driving and using machines Aclasta has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines .
Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg given as one infusion per year into a vein by your doctor or nurse .
The infusion will take at least 15 minutes .
In case you recently broke your hip , it is recommended that Aclasta is administered two or more weeks after your hip repair surgery .
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse .
It is important to take calcium and vitamin D supplements ( for example tablets ) as directed by your doctor .
For osteoporosis , Aclasta works for one year and you will need the next dose after one year .
27 Paget s disease The usual dose is 5 mg , given to you as one single infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse .
The infusion will take at least 15 minutes .
As Aclasta works for a long time , you may not need another dose of Aclasta for a year or longer .
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse .
Your doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements ( e. g. tablets ) for at least the first ten days after being given Aclasta .
It is important that you follow this advice carefully so that the level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the infusion .
Your doctor will inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia .
For Paget s disease Aclasta may work for longer than one year , and your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated again .
If a dose of Aclasta is missed Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment .
Before stopping Aclasta therapy If you are considering stopping Aclasta treatment , please go to your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Aclasta .
If you have any questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor , pharmacist or nurse .
Like all medicines , Aclasta can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
In most cases , no specific treatment is required .
Side effects related to the first infusion are very common ( occurring in more than 30 % of patients ) but are less common following subsequent infusions .
The majority of the side effects , such as fever and chills , pain in the muscles or joints , and headache , occur within the first three days following the dose of Aclasta .
The symptoms are usually mild to moderate and go away within three days.
Your doctor can recommend a mild pain reliever such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to reduce these side effects .
The chance of experiencing these side effects decreases with subsequent doses of Aclasta .
Irregular heart rhythm ( atrial fibrillation ) has been seen in patients receiving Aclasta for post- menopausal osteoporosis .
It is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have received Aclasta .
Very common side effects ( affecting 10 or more in every 100 patients ) :
Common side effects ( affecting less than 10 in every 100 patients ) :
Fever and chills , headache , feeling sick , pain in your muscles , pain in your bones and/ or joints , tiredness , weakness , dizziness , vomiting , pain in your back , arms or legs .
In patients with Paget s disease : symptoms due to low blood calcium , such as muscle spasms , or numbness , or a tingling sensation especially in the area around the mouth .
Uncommon side effects ( affecting less than 1 in every 100 patients ) :
Flu , sleeplessness , tiredness , feeling of pins and needles or tingling sensation , drowsiness , tremor , temporary loss of consciousness , taste disturbance , diarrhoea , indigestion , abdominal pain , dry mouth , inflammation of oesophagus , toothache , joint pain , joint swelling , stiffness , eating disorder , redness , itching and pain in the eyes , chest pain , increased blood pressure , flushing , shortness of breath , rash ,
Rare side effects ( affecting less than 1 in every 1,000 patients ) :
Skin reactions such as redness , swelling and/ or pain at the infusion site may occur .
Bisphosphonates ( the group of substances Aclasta belongs to ) may cause swelling , redness , pain and itching of the eyes or eye sensitivity to light .
Persistent pain and/ or non-healing sores of the mouth or jaw have been reported primarily in patients treated with bisphosphonates for other illnesses .
If you experience these symptoms , tell your doctor or dentist .
Allergic reactions have been reported including rare cases of difficulty breathing , hives and angioedema ( such as swollen face , tongue or throat ) .
There have been isolated reports of very serious allergic reactions .
If you notice any of these side effects , tell your doctor .
If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , pharmacist or nurse .

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only :
The dose of 5 mg of zoledronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minutes .
Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min ) due to lack of adequate clinical experience in this population .
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to and following administration of Aclasta ; this is especially important for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) .
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta .
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated ( e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve , intestinal calcium malabsorption ) .
Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients .
Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget s disease of the bone .
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover , transient hypocalcaemia , sometimes symptomatic , may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta .
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget 's disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration .
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk .
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion .
How to prepare and administer Aclasta

er wünschen , lesen Sie bitte die wissenschaftliche Diskussion ( ebenfalls Teil des EPAR ) . What is ACOMPLIA ?
ACOMPLIA is a medicine containing the active substance rimonabant .
It is available as white , teardrop- shaped tablets . no
ACOMPLIA is used together with diet and exercise to treat adult patients : who are obese ( very overweight ) with a body mass index ( BMI ) greater than or equal to 30 kg/ m² , who are overweight ( with a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/ m² ) and also have other risk factors , ct
such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia ( abnormal levels of fat in their blood ) .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription . du
ACOMPLIA is taken as one tablet once a day , before breakfast .
Die Patienten sollten eine kalorienverminderte Ernährung einhalten und die körperliche Bewegung steigern . The medicine should not be used in patients who ro
have severe problems with their liver or their kidneys . lp
The active substance in ACOMPLIA , rimonabant , is a cannabinoid receptor antagonist .
It acts by blocking a specific type of receptor , the cannabinoid type 1 ( CB1 ) receptors .
Diese Rezeptoren sind im Nervensystem zu finden , und sie sind Teil des körpereigenen eim The receptors are ina
also found in adipocytes ( fat tissue ) .
The effects of ACOMPLIA were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans . dic
Four studies of ACOMPLIA in overweight and obese patients were carried out , involving almost 7,000 patients , whose weight at the start of the studies was on average 94 to 104 kg .

One study also looked at how this loss could be maintained during the second year .
ise Four studies of ACOMPLIA as a help to stop smoking were also carried out in over 7,000 patients , comparing it with placebo , and measuring the effect of the medicine given for 10 weeks ( one year in one of the studies ) on smoking cessation , and on relapses in the following year .
or What benefit has ACOMPLIA shown during the studies ?
After one year , all patients who received ACOMPLIA lost more weight than those who received placebo : they lost on average 4.9 kg more than placebo , except in the study in diabetic patients , where the
uth difference in the weight loss was 3.9 kg .
The medicine also reduced the risk of regaining weight .
The studies in smoking cessation did not show consistent results , and the effect of ACOMPLIA in this area was difficult to estimate .
The company decided to withdraw its application for smoking cessation .
Therefore , ACOMPLIA is not recommended as an aid for smoking cessation
Welches Risiko ist mit ACOMPLIA verbunden ? er Die häufigsten Nebenwirkungen von ACOMPLIA , die während der Studien ( beobachtet bei mehr als 1 von 10 Patienten ) festgestellt wurden , waren Nausea ( Übelkeit ) und Infektionen der oberen Atemwege. ng Die vollständige Auflistung der im Zusammenhang mit ACOMPLIA berichteten Nebenwirkungen ist der Packungsbeilage zu entnehmen . During the studies , the most common side effects with ACOMPLIA ( seen in more than 1 patient in 10 ) were nausea ( feeling sick ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
For the full list of all side effects
ge reported with ACOMPLIA , see the Package Leaflet .
ACOMPLIA should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to rimonabant or any of the other ingredients , or in women who are breast feeding .
It must also not be used in patients with ongoing major depression or who are being treated with antidepressants , since it can increase the risk of lon depression , including thoughts about suicide in a small minority of patients .
Patients who experience symptoms of depression should speak to their doctor and may need to stop treatment .
Caution should be used when taking ACOMPLIA with some medicines , such as ketoconazole or itraconazole ( anti-fungal medicines ) , ritonavir ( used in HIV infection ) , or telithromycin or clarithromycin ( antibiotics ) . no
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) concluded that ACOMPLIA had shown its effectiveness in weight reduction in obese or overweight patients with associated risk factors .
The Committee decided that ACOMPLIA s benefits are greater than its risks when used , in addition to diet and ct
exercise , to treat obese patients and overweight patients with risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia .
The Committee recommended that ACOMPLIA be given marketing authorisation . du
Arzneimittel bei Patienten angewendet wird , die es aus gesundheitlichen und nicht aus kosmetischen Gründen benötigen ( durch Bereitstellung von Aufklärungspaketen für Patienten und Ärzte ) , und um die Arz The company that makes ACOMPLIA will put in place a programme to ensure that the medicine is used in patients who need it for health , rather than for cosmetic reasons , by providing educational packs for ro
patients and doctors , and to monitor how the medicine is used .
The company will use specific databases to monitor ACOMPLIA s side effects , especially those linked to the nervous system . lp
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for ACOMPLIA to sanofi-aventis on 19 June 2006. ina

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
Ongoing major depressive illness and/ or ongoing antidepressive treatment ( see section 4.4 )
or Depressive disorders or mood alterations with depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 10 % , and suicidal ideation in up to 1 % , of patients receiving rimonabant ( see section 4.8 ) .
In patients with current suicidal ideations and/ or with a history of suicidal ideation and depressive disorder rimonabant
uth should not be used unless the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh these risks in an individual patient .
( See section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
Obesity is a condition that can be associated with depressive disorders .
Depressive disorders can be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts , self harm and suicide .
ra The prescriber should carefully investigate if the patient has had a depressive disorder in the past in order to evaluate the potential risks with rimonabant treatment .
ge Depressive reactions may occur in patients who have no obvious risk factors , apart from obesity itself .
In postmarketing experience , more than half of the patients who develop such reactions appear to do so within 1 month of starting treatment , approximately 80 % appear to do so within 3 months . lon Patients should be actively monitored for signs and symptoms of psychiatric disorders , particularly depression following the start of treatment .
Der Patient muss angemessen überwacht und behandelt werden . The patient should be monitored and treated appropriately .
Patients , especially those with a history of depressive disorders/ mood alterations , ( and relatives or no
other relevant persons ) should be alerted about the need to monitor for the emergence of such symptoms and to seek medical advice immediately if these occur .
Other psychiatric conditions ct
Therapy with rimonabant is not recommended in patients with uncontrolled psychiatric illness .
If psychiatric illness is diagnosed during rimonabant therapy , treatment must be stopped . du

uth Rimonabant should be used with caution in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e. g. ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir , telithromycin , clarithromycin , nefazodone)(see section 4.5 ) .
ra Since ACOMPLIA tablets contain lactose , patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption , should not take this medicine .
ge Patients should be instructed not to increase their dose of ACOMPLIA .
Patients who had a cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction , stroke , etc. ) less than 6 months ago lon were excluded in the studies for rimonabant .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Rimonabant is metabolized by both CYP3A and amidohydrolase ( predominantly hepatic ) pathways in no
Die gleichzeitige Verabreichung von CYP3A4-Inhibitoren führt zu einer erhöhten Exposition gegenüber Rimonabant . Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors will lead to increased exposure of rimonabant .
Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers is expected to reduce the exposure of rimonabant . ct
Potential for other medicinal products to affect rimonabant :
Concomitant administration of ketoconazole ( a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ) increased rimonabant AUC du
by 104 % ( 95 % prediction interval :
A similar increase in exposure is expected with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors .
Caution is advised during concomitant use of ACOMPLIA and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e. g. ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir , telithromycin , clarithromycin , nefazodone ) . ro
Although concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers ( e. g. rifampicin , phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , St John s wort ) has not been studied , it is expected that concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers may reduce the plasma concentration of rimonabant and may result in loss of lp
efficacy .
Concomitant administration of orlistat , ethanol or lorazepam had no significant effect on the plasma ina
Potential for rimonabant to affect other medicinal products :
The in vivo inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 has not been studied .
However , in vitro , rimonabant had a dic
mild inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 .
The potential for inhibition of CYP2C8 in vivo appears to be low .
Rimonabant does not inhibit or induce other CYP enzymes or P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) in vitro .
Diese Beobachtung wurde klinisch durch spezifische Interaktionsstudien bestätigt , in denen Midazolam ( CYP3A4-Substrat ) , Warfarin ( CYP2C9-Substrat ) und Digoxin ( ein P- gp-Substrat ) untersucht wurden. er Die Steady-State-Pharmakokinetik eines oralen Kontrazeptivums mit einer ng Ethinylestradiol/Levonorgestrel-Kombination wurde durch die gleichzeitige Gabe von Rimonabant nicht signifikant verändert. t lä Me
Es liegen keine hinreichenden oder gut kontrollierten Studien bei Schwangeren vor . Animal data are inconclusive but
d suggest possible deleterious effects on embryonal/ foetal development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Use in pregnancy is , therefore , not recommended .
Patients should notify
ise their physician if they become pregnant during treatment with ACOMPLIA .
Rimonabant has been detected in the milk of lactating rats and rimonabant may inhibit the suckling reflex .
It is not known if rimonabant is excreted in human milk .
ACOMPLIA is contraindicated during
or breast-feeding ( see section 4.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
uth No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
Cognitive investigations in clinical pharmacology studies demonstrated that rimonabant is devoid of any significant cognitive or sedative effect .
ACOMPLIA 20 mg has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2500 patients enrolled in studies
ge that examined the metabolic and weight loss effects in overweight and obese patients and in approximately 3800 patients in other indications .
In placebo-controlled studies , the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 15.7 % for patients receiving rimonabant .
The most common adverse lon reactions resulting in discontinuation were : nausea , mood alteration with depressive symptoms , depressive disorders , anxiety and dizziness .
Depressive disorders were reported in 3.2 % of obese patients , or overweight patients with associated risk factor(s ) treated with rimonabant 20 mg .
These were usually mild or moderate in severity and no
resulted in recovery in all cases either after corrective treatment or discontinuation of rimonabant and did not exhibit any differentiating characteristics compared to cases reported in the control groups .
The following table ( table 1 ) shows all treatment-emergent adverse reactions from placebo-controlled ct

ise Nervous disorders : convulsions , disturbance in attention , headache . gastrointestinal disorders : abdominal pain .
or ACOMPLIA has not been shown to alter laboratory test values .
uth Experience with rimonabant in overdosage is limited .
In a single-dose tolerability study , doses up to 300 mg were administered to a limited number of subjects with only minor symptoms reported .
Hierunter waren Kopfschmerzen , Euphorie , Müdigkeit und ng Schlaflosigkeit . The pharmacokinetic profile demonstrates that a
ra plateau in exposures is reached at 180 mg .
There is no specific antidote for rimonabant ; therefore , appropriate supportive measures should be initiated in case of overdose .
Treatment should consist of the general measures employed in the management of overdoses , such as keeping airways
ge unobstructed , monitoring cardiovascular function and general symptomatic and supportive measures .

triglycerides an average decrease of 6.9 % was seen under rimonabant 20 mg ( baseline TG 1.62 mmol/ l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 % for placebo ( baseline TG 1.65 mmol/ l ) .
The difference was statistically significant ( Difference -13.3 % CI95 % -16.5 ; -10.2 % p < 0.001 ) .
It is estimated that approximately half of the observed improvement in HDL-C and triglycerides in patients who received dic
rimonabant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone .
Generally ACOMPLIA 20 mg had no significant effect on Total-C or LDL-C levels .
In the trial in type 2 diabetic patients ( RIO-Diabetes ) who were overweight or obese treated with Me
The absolute change in HbA1c at one year was -0.6 for rimonabant 20 mg ( baseline 7.3 % ) and +0.1 on placebo ( baseline 7.2 % ) .
Differences were statistically significant ( Difference -0.7 % , CI95 % -0.80 ; -0.5 , p < 0.001 ) .
8 At one year a mean weight loss of 5.3 kg was shown for ACOMPLIA 20 mg versus a loss on placebo of 1.4 kg ( Difference 3.9 kg CI95 % -4.6 ; -3.3 p < 0.001 ) .
The percentage of patients who lost 5 % and 10 % of their baseline body weight after 1 year of treatment are given in the table 2.
d In a second trial in treatment naïve type 2 diabetic obese patients ( Serenade ) , the absolute change in HbA1c ( with a baseline of 7.9 % for both groups ) at six months was -0.8 for rimonabant 20 mg and
ise -0.3 under placebo ( Difference -0.51 CI95 % -0.78 , -0.24 p < 0.001 ) .
The percentage of patients reaching HbA1c < 7 % was 51 % in the rimonabant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
The difference in mean body weight change between the 20 mg and placebo groups was 3.8 kg ( CI95 % -5.0 , -2.6 p < 0.001 ) .
Changes in HDL-C and TG in this population were similar to that of the non-diabetic population .
or estimated that approximately half of the mean improvement in HbA1c in patients receiving rimonabant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone .
Rimonabant pharmacokinetics are fairly dose proportional up to about 20 mg .
AUC increased less than in proportion to dose above 20 mg .
Rimonabant displays high in vitro permeability and is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein .
The absolute bioavailability of rimonabant has not been determined .
Following multiple once-daily doses of 20 mg
ge to healthy subjects in the fasted state , maximum plasma concentrations of rimonabant are achieved in approximately 2 hours with steady state plasma levels achieved within 13 days ( Cmax = 196 ± 28.1 ng/ ml ; Ctrough = 91.6 ± 14.1 ng/ ml ; AUC0-24 = 2960 ± 268 ng . h/ ml ) .
Steady state rimonabant lon exposures are 3.3-fold higher than those observed after the first dose .
Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated less fluctuation in peak to trough plasma concentration but no differences in steady state AUC as weight increases .
As weight increases from 65 to 200 kg , Cmax is expected to decrease 24 % and Ctrough is expected to increase by 5 % .

pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that rimonabant pharmacokinetics are similar between healthy non-smoking subjects and patients who smoke .
Administration of rimonabant to healthy subjects in the fasted state or with a high fat meal demonstrated that Cmax and AUC were increased 67 % and 48 % respectively , under fed conditions .
In clinical studies , ACOMPLIA 20 mg was taken in the morning usually before breakfast . du
The in vitro human plasma protein binding of rimonabant is high ( > 99.9 % ) and non-saturable over a ro
wide concentration range .
The apparent peripheral volume of distribution of rimonabant appears to be related to body weight , with obese patients having a higher volume of distribution than normal-weight subjects . lp

In single- and repeat-dose studies , the Cmax and AUC of rimonabant were similar in healthy Japanese
d and Caucasian subjects , whereas elimination half-life was shorter in Japanese subjects ( 3-4 days ) compared to Caucasian subjects ( about 9 days ) .
The difference in half-life was due to differences in
ise peripheral volume of distribution as a consequence of lower weight in Japanese subjects .
Black patients may have up to a 31 % lower Cmax and a 43 % lower AUC than patients of other races .
or The pharmacokinetics of rimonabant are similar in female and male patients .
uth Elderly patients have slightly higher exposure than young patients .
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis ( age range 18 - 81 years ) a 75 year old patient is estimated to have a 21 % higher Cmax and a 27 % higher AUC than a 40 year old patient .
Mild hepatic impairment does not alter rimonabant exposure .
Data are insufficient to draw conclusions regarding pharmacokinetics in moderate hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not evaluated .
The effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of rimonabant has not been studied specifically . lon Based on data from population pharmacokinetic studies , mild renal impairment do not seem to affect the pharmacokinetics of rimonabant .
Limited data suggest an increased exposure in patients with moderate renal impairment ( 40 % increase in AUC ) .
There are no data in severe renal impairment .
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies , but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows :
Convulsions were observed sporadically in studies in rodents and macaques .
observed in dogs during a 3 month study .
In some , but not all cases , initiation of convulsions appeared to be associated with procedural stress such as handling of the animals .
A proconvulsant activity of rimonabant was found in one of two safety pharmacology studies .
No adverse effect of rimonabant du
treatment was observed on EEG patterns in rats .
Increased incidence and/ or severity of clinical signs suggestive of increased tactile hyperesthesia were ro
observed in rodent studies .
A direct effect of rimonabant cannot be ruled out .
In standard fertility studies in female rats ( dosing for 2 weeks prior to mating ) there was abnormal ina
oestrous cyclicity and a decrease in corpora lutea and fertility index at doses of rimonabant that induced maternal toxicity ( 30 and 60 mg/ kg/ day ) .
Following dosing for a longer treatment duration prior to mating ( 9 weeks ) that permitted recovery from the initial effects of rimonabant , no adverse effects were seen on fertility or oestrous cyclicity .
Regarding reproductive parameters , at 30 mg/ kg no dic
differences were observed between treated animals and controls , at 60 mg/ kg effects were still observed ( decreased number of corpora lutea , implantations , total and viable fetuses ) .
Sporadic malformations ( anencephaly , micro-ophthalmia , widened brain ventricles and omphalocele ) Me
were observed in the rabbit embryofetal toxicity studies at doses resulting in exposures comparable with the clinical exposures .
Although maternal toxicity was observed at these doses , a relation to treatment cannot be excluded .
No treatment-related malformations were seen in the rat .
10 Effects of rimonabant on pre- and post-natal development were assessed in the rat at doses up to 10 mg/ kg/ day .
There was a treatment related increase in pup mortality in the pre-weaning period .
The increased pup mortality might be attributable to a failure of the dam to nurse or ingestion of
d rimonabant in milk and/ or inhibition of the suckling reflex that is reported in the literature to be initiated in neonatal mice by endocannabinoid signalling via CB1 receptors .
There are reports in the
The potential relevance of this to administration of a CB1 antagonist is unknown .
In the pre- and post-natal development study in rats , exposure to rimonabant in utero and via lactation produced no alterations on learning or memory , but equivocal effects on motor
or activity and auditory startle response were observed in the pups as a result of rimonabant exposure .

Actos is a medicine containing the active substance pioglitazone .
The white , round tablets contain 15 , 30 or 45 mg of pioglitazone .
Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non insulin-dependent diabetes ) . It can be used on its own ( monotherapy ) in patients ( particularly those who are overweight ) who cannot use metformin ( an antidiabetic medicine ) . It can be used together with one other antidiabetic medicine ( dual therapy ) .
It can be added to metformin in patients ( particularly those who are overweight ) who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin used on its own and at the maximum tolerated dose .
Alternatively , it can be added to a sulphonylurea ( another antidiabetic medicine ) in patients for whom metformin is not suitable and who are not satisfactorily controlled with the sulphonylurea used on its own at the maximum tolerated dose . It can be used together with two other antidiabetic medicines , metformin and a sulphonylurea , as triple therapy in patients ( particularly those who are overweight ) who are not satisfactorily controlled with these two medicines . It can be used together with insulin in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled with insulin alone and cannot take metformin .
Actos is taken once daily with or without food .
The dose is adjusted to give the best control .
The recommended starting dose is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily .
This dose may need to be increased after one or two weeks to up to 45 mg once daily .
In combination with metformin , the current metformin dose can be continued when starting Actos treatment .
In combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin , the current sulphonylurea or insulin dose can be continued when starting Actos treatment unless the patient has hypoglycaemia ( low blood glucose ) , when the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin should be decreased .

Actos has been studied in clinical pharmacology studies and in clinical trials .
Almost 7,000 patients received Actos in all trials combined .
The studies compared Actos to placebo ( a dummy treatment ) , or to other antidiabetic medicines ( metformin , gliclazide ) .
Some studies also looked at combining Actos with other antidiabetic medicines ( sulphonylureas , insulin , metformin ) .
Further studies also looked at long-term use of Actos .
In triple therapy , the effectiveness of Actos was studied in more than 1,400 patients who were receiving a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea , to which was added either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
The studies measured the level in the blood of a substance ( glycosylated haemoglobin , HbA1c ) , which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled .
What benefit has Actos shown during the studies ?
Actos led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c , indicating that blood glucose levels had been reduced at doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
Doses below 15 mg were not effective , and doses above 45 mg ( once daily ) did not show additional benefit .
Actos on its own was shown to be as effective as metformin and gliclazide .
In combination , Actos showed that it improves the control obtained in type 2 diabetes when added to existing treatment .
At the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of adding Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonylurea was a 0.94 % reduction in HbA1c levels , while adding placebo led to a 0.35 % reduction .
In a small study examining the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients , patients adding Actos to insulin had a 0.69 % reduction in HbA1c levels after 6 months , compared to 0.14 % in those adding placebo .
The most common side effects with Actos are visual disturbance , upper respiratory tract infection ( colds ) , weight increase , and hypoaesthesia ( decreased sensitivity to a stimulus ) .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Actos , see the Package Leaflet .
Actos should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis ( high levels of ketones [ acids ] in the blood ) .
Der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel ( CHMP ) gelangte zu dem Schluss , dass die Vorteile von Actos bei der Behandlung von Typ-2-Diabetes gegenüber den Risiken überwiegen , und empfahl , die Genehmigung für das Inverkehrbringen von Actos zu erteilen . The committee recommended that Actos be given marketing authorisation .
In monotherapy ( used on its own ) , the committee decided that Actos should be an alternative to the standard treatment , metformin , to be used when patients cannot take metformin .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Actos to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited on 13 October 2000.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 13 October 2005.
The full EPAR for Actos is available here
Each tablet contains 15 mg of pioglitazone as hydrochloride .
For a full list of excipients , see 6.1 .
The tablets are white to off-white , round , convex and marked 15 on one face and ACTOS on the other face .
Pioglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus :
- in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise
for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance
- metformin , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient glycaemic
control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin
- a sulphonylurea , only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom
metformin is contraindicated , with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea .
- metformin and a sulphonylurea , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient
glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy .
Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance ( see section 4.4 ) .
Pioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food .
Pioglitazone may be initiated at 15mg or 30mg once daily .
The dose may be increased in increments up to 45mg once daily .
2 In combination with insulin , the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone therapy .
If patients report hypoglycaemia , the dose of insulin should be decreased .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function ( creatinine clearance > 4 ml/ min ) ( see section 5.2 ) .
No information is available from dialysed patients therefore pioglitazone should not be used in such patients .
Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4 ) .
There are no data available on the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age , and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group .
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure ( NYHA stages I to IV )
Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention , which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure .
When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure ( e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease ) , physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oedema particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve .
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulinor in patients with a history of cardiac failure ; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin .
Since insulin and pioglitazone are associated with fluid retention , concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema .
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs .
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease .
Pioglitazone or placebo was added to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years .
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group .
There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience ( see section 4.8 ) .
It is recommended , therefore , that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes .
Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with pioglitazone in all patients .
Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels ( ALT > 2.5 X upper limit of normal ) or with any other evidence of liver disease .
Following initiation of therapy with pioglitazone , it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical judgement .
If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy , liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible .
If ALT levels remain > 3 X the upper limit of normal , therapy should be discontinued .
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction , which may include unexplained nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , anorexia and/ or dark urine , liver enzymes should be checked .
The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations .
If jaundice is observed , drug therapy should be discontinued .
In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain , which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure , therefore weight should be closely monitored .
Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control .
Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie-controlled diet .
There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin ( 4 % relative reduction ) and haematocrit ( 4.1 % relative reduction ) during therapy with pioglitazone , consistent with haemodilution .
Similar changes were seen in metformin ( haemoglobin 3 - 4 % and haematocrit 3.6 4.1 % relative reductions ) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin ( haemoglobin 1 2 % and haematocrit 1 3.2 % relative reductions ) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone .
As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia , and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary .
Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones , including pioglitazone .
Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral oedema .
It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered .
An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised , controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients , on treatment for up to 3.5 years .
Fractures were observed in 2.6 % of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7 % of women treated with a comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
4 The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator .
The observed excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 100 patient years of use .
In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study , 44/ 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone .
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action , pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation .
These patients may be at risk of pregnancy .
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs , the treatment should be discontinued ( see section 4.6 ) .
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors ( e. g. gemfibrozil ) or inducers ( e. g. rifampicin ) .
Glycaemic control should be monitored closely .
Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered ( see section 4.5 ) .
Actos tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea .
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450 , 1A , 2C8/ 9 and 3A4 .
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes , e. g. oral contraceptives , cyclosporin , calcium channel blockers , and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone .
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related adverse events , a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
Co- administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 54 % decrease in AUC of pioglitazone .
The pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
Es liegen keine ausreichenden Daten am Menschen vor , um die Sicherheit von Pioglitazon während der Schwangerschaft zu belegen.In tierexperimentellen Studien mit Pioglitazon wurde ein verzögertes Wachstum des Föten beobachtet . Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in pregnancy .
Pioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk .
Therefore , pioglitazone should not be administered to breast-feeding women .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed .
Adverse reactions reported in excess ( > 0.5 % ) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients receiving pioglitazone in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency .
Frequencies are defined as : very common > 1/ 10 ; common > 1/ 100 , , 1/ 1000 ,
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH METFORMIN Blood and lymphatic system disorders
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH SULPHONYLUREA Ear and labyrinth disorders
PIOGLITAZONE IN TRIPLE ORAL COMBINATION THERAPY WITH METFORMIN AND SULPHONYLUREA
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH INSULIN Metabolism and nutrition disorders
8 Oedema was reported in 6 9 % of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled clinical trials .
The oedema rates for comparator groups ( sulphonylurea , metformin ) were 2 5 % .
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment .
In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy was 2 3 kg over one year .
This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group .
In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg .
In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a mean weight loss of 1.0 kg .
Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents .
In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups .
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone .
Rare cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing experience .
Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported , causal relationship has not been established .
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo , metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups , but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin .
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease , the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6 % higher with pioglitazone than with placebo , when added to therapy that included insulin .
However , this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone , but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure .
A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised , comparator controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration .
A higher rate of fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone ( 2.6 % ) versus comparator ( 1.7 % ) .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
In the 3.5 year PROactive study , 44/ 870 ( 5.1 % ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 ( 2.5 % ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
Patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 45 mg daily .
The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/ day for four days , then 180 mg/ day for seven days was not associated with any symptoms .
Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin .
Symptomatic and general supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : oral blood glucose lowering drugs ; Thiazolidinediones ; ATC code :
9 Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance .
Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors ( peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals .
Treatment with pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of insulin resistance .
Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
The improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations .
A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure ( defined as appearance of HbA1c 8.0 % after the first six months of therapy ) .
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients treated with gliclazide , compared with pioglitazone .
At two years , glycaemic control ( defined as HbA1c < 8.0 % ) was sustained in 69 % of patients treated with pioglitazone , compared with 50 % of patients on gliclazide .
In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin , glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year .
The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide .
In a placebo controlled trial , patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months .
Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45 % compared with those continuing on insulin alone , and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group .
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin sensitivity .
Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect .
In one year clinical trials , pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the albumin/ creatinine ratio compared to baseline .
The effect of pioglitazone ( 45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo ) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics .
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain .
Visceral fat was significantly decreased , while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass .
Similar changes in body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity .
In most clinical trials , reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo , with small , but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels .
In clinical trials of up to two years duration , pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL cholesterol levels , compared with placebo , metformin or gliclazide .
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo , whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide .
In a 20-week study , as well as reducing fasting triglycerides , pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides .
These effects were independent of pioglitazone s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide .
In PROactive , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy , for up to 3.5 years .
The study population had an average age of 62 years ; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years .
Approximately one third of patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/ or a sulphonylurea .
To be eligible patients had to have had one or more of the following : myocardial infarction , stroke , percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft , acute coronary syndrome , coronary artery disease , or peripheral arterial obstructive disease .
Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 20 % had had a stroke .
Approximately half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria .
Almost all subjects ( 95 % ) were receiving cardiovascular medications ( beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II antagonists , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , diuretics , aspirin , statins , fibrates ) .
10 Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint , which was a composite of all-cause mortality , non- fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , acute coronary syndrome , major leg amputation , coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation , the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone .
However , the incidences of oedema , weight gain and heart failure were increased .
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed .
Following oral administration , pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration .
Proportional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 60 mg .
Steady state is achieved after 4 7 days of dosing .
Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites .
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l/ kg .
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein ( > 99 % ) .
Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups .
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser degree .
Three of the six identified metabolites are active ( M-II , M-III , and M-IV ) .
When activity , concentrations and protein binding are taken into account , pioglitazone and metabolite M-III contribute equally to efficacy .
On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold that of pioglitazone , whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal .
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
There is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A , 2C8/ 9 , and 3A4 in man .
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) or with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to increase or decrease , respectively , the plasma concentration of pioglitazone ( see section 4.5 ) .
Following oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man , recovered label was mainly in faeces ( 55 % ) and a lesser amount in urine ( 45 % ) .
In animals , only a small amount of unchanged pioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces .
The mean plasma elimination half-life of unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours .
Steady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects .
In patients with renal impairment , plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function , but oral clearance of parent substance is similar .
Thus free ( unbound ) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged .
Total plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged , but with an increased volume of distribution .
Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced , coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone .
In toxicology studies , plasma volume expansion with haemodilution , anaemia , and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice , rats , dogs , and monkeys .
In addition , increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed .
These findings were observed across species at plasma concentrations 4 times the clinical exposure .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity assays .
An increased incidence of hyperplasia ( males and females ) and tumours ( males ) of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years .
There was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex .
Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not seen in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 12 months .
In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , treatment with two other thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon .

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
Each tablet contains 30 mg of pioglitazone as hydrochloride .
For a full list of excipients , see 6.1 .
The tablets are white to off-white , round , flat and marked 30 on one face and ACTOS on the other face .
Pioglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus :
- in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise
for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance
- metformin , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient glycaemic
control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin
- a sulphonylurea , only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom
metformin is contraindicated , with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea .
- metformin and a sulphonylurea , in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) with insufficient
glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy .
Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance ( see section 4.4 ) .
Pioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food .
Pioglitazone may be initiated at 15mg or 30mg once daily .
The dose may be increased in increments up to 45mg once daily .
In combination with insulin , the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone therapy .
If patients report hypoglycaemia , the dose of insulin should be decreased .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function ( creatinine clearance > 4 ml/ min ) ( see section 5.2 ) .
No information is available from dialysed patients therefore pioglitazone should not be used in such patients .
Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment ( see section 4.4 ) .
There are no data available on the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age , and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group .
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure ( NYHA stages I to IV )
Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention , which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure .
When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure ( e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease ) , physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oedema particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve .
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulinor in patients with a history of cardiac failure ; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin .
Since insulin and pioglitazone are associated with fluid retention , concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema .
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs .
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease .
Pioglitazone or placebo was added to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years .
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group .
There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience ( see section 4.8 ) .
It is recommended , therefore , that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes .
Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with pioglitazone in all
Bei Patienten mit erhöhten Ausgangs-Leberenzymwerten ( ALT > 2,5 x Obergrenze des Normbereichs ) oder mit anderen Anzeichen einer Lebererkrankung darf Pioglitazon nicht eingesetzt werden . Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels ( ALT > 2.5 X upper limit of normal ) or with any other evidence of liver disease .
Following initiation of therapy with pioglitazone , it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical judgement .
If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy , liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible .
If ALT levels remain > 3 X the upper limit of normal , therapy should be discontinued .
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction , which may include unexplained nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , anorexia and/ or dark urine , liver enzymes should be checked .
The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations .
If jaundice is observed , drug therapy should be discontinued .
In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain , which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure , therefore weight should be closely monitored .
Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control .
Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie-controlled diet .
There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin ( 4 % relative reduction ) and haematocrit ( 4.1 % relative reduction ) during therapy with pioglitazone , consistent with haemodilution .
Similar changes were seen in metformin ( haemoglobin 3 - 4 % and haematocrit 3.6 4.1 % relative reductions ) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin ( haemoglobin 1 2 % and haematocrit 1 3.2 % relative reductions ) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone .
As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia , and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary .
Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones , including pioglitazone .
Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral oedema .
It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered .
An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised , controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients , on treatment for up to 3.5 years .
Fractures were observed in 2.6 % of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7 % of women treated with a comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator .
The observed excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 100 patient years of use .
16 In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study , 44/ 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone .
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action , pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation .
These patients may be at risk of pregnancy .
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs , the treatment should be discontinued ( see section 4.6 ) .
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors ( e. g. gemfibrozil ) or inducers ( e. g. rifampicin ) .
Glycaemic control should be monitored closely .
Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered ( see section 4.5 ) .
Actos tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea .
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450 , 1A , 2C8/ 9 and 3A4 .
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes , e. g. oral contraceptives , cyclosporin , calcium channel blockers , and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone .
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related adverse events , a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
Co- administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 54 % decrease in AUC of pioglitazone .
The pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
There are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in pregnancy .
Pioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk .
Therefore , pioglitazone should not be administered to breast-feeding women .
17 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed .
Adverse reactions reported in excess ( > 0.5 % ) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients receiving pioglitazone in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency .
Frequencies are defined as : very common > 1/ 10 ; common > 1/ 100 , , 1/ 1000 ,
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH METFORMIN Blood and lymphatic system disorders
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH SULPHONYLUREA Ear and labyrinth disorders
19 PIOGLITAZONE IN TRIPLE ORAL COMBINATION THERAPY WITH METFORMIN AND SULPHONYLUREA
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH INSULIN Metabolism and nutrition disorders
Oedema was reported in 6 9 % of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled clinical trials .
The oedema rates for comparator groups ( sulphonylurea , metformin ) were 2 5 % .
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment .
20 In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy was 2 3 kg over one year .
This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group .
In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg .
In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a mean weight loss of 1.0 kg .
Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents .
In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups .
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone .
Rare cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing experience .
Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported , causal relationship has not been established .
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo , metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups , but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin .
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease , the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6 % higher with pioglitazone than with placebo , when added to therapy that included insulin .
However , this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone , but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure .
A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised , comparator controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration .
A higher rate of fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone ( 2.6 % ) versus comparator ( 1.7 % ) .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
In the 3.5 year PROactive study , 44/ 870 ( 5.1 % ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 ( 2.5 % ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
Patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 45 mg daily .
The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/ day for four days , then 180 mg/ day for seven days was not associated with any symptoms .
Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin .
Symptomatic and general supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : oral blood glucose lowering drugs ; Thiazolidinediones ; ATC code :
Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance .
Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors ( peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals .
Treatment with pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of insulin resistance .
21 Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
The improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations .
A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure ( defined as appearance of HbA1c 8.0 % after the first six months of therapy ) .
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients treated with gliclazide , compared with pioglitazone .
At two years , glycaemic control ( defined as HbA1c < 8.0 % ) was sustained in 69 % of patients treated with pioglitazone , compared with 50 % of patients on gliclazide .
In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin , glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year .
The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide .
In a placebo controlled trial , patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months .
Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45 % compared with those continuing on insulin alone , and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group .
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin sensitivity .
Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect .
In one year clinical trials , pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the albumin/ creatinine ratio compared to baseline .
The effect of pioglitazone ( 45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo ) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics .
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain .
Visceral fat was significantly decreased , while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass .
Similar changes in body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity .
In most clinical trials , reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo , with small , but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels .
In clinical trials of up to two years duration , pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL cholesterol levels , compared with placebo , metformin or gliclazide .
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo , whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide .
In a 20-week study , as well as reducing fasting triglycerides , pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides .
These effects were independent of pioglitazone s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide .
In PROactive , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy , for up to 3.5 years .
The study population had an average age of 62 years ; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years .
Approximately one third of patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/ or a sulphonylurea .
To be eligible patients had to have had one or more of the following : myocardial infarction , stroke , percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft , acute coronary syndrome , coronary artery disease , or peripheral arterial obstructive disease .
Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 20 % had had a stroke .
Approximately half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria .
Almost all subjects ( 95 % ) were receiving cardiovascular medications ( beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II antagonists , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , diuretics , aspirin , statins , fibrates ) .
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint , which was a composite of all-cause mortality , non- fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , acute coronary syndrome , major leg amputation , coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation , the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular
However , the incidences of oedema , weight gain and heart failure were increased .
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed .
Following oral administration , pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration .
Proportional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 60 mg .
Steady state is achieved after 4 7 days of dosing .
Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites .
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l/ kg .
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein ( > 99 % ) .
Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups .
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser degree .
Three of the six identified metabolites are active ( M-II , M-III , and M-IV ) .
When activity , concentrations and protein binding are taken into account , pioglitazone and metabolite M-III contribute equally to efficacy .
On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold that of pioglitazone , whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal .
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
There is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A , 2C8/ 9 , and 3A4 in man .
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) or with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to increase or decrease , respectively , the plasma concentration of pioglitazone ( see section 4.5 ) .
Following oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man , recovered label was mainly in faeces ( 55 % ) and a lesser amount in urine ( 45 % ) .
In animals , only a small amount of unchanged pioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces .
The mean plasma elimination half-life of unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours .
Steady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects .
In patients with renal impairment , plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function , but oral clearance of parent substance is similar .
Thus free ( unbound ) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged .
Total plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged , but with an increased volume of distribution .
Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced , coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone .
In toxicology studies , plasma volume expansion with haemodilution , anaemia , and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice , rats , dogs , and monkeys .
In addition , increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed .
These findings were observed across species at plasma concentrations 4 times the clinical exposure .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity assays .

In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , treatment with two other thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon .

It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered .
An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised , controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients , on treatment for up to 3.5 years .
Fractures were observed in 2.6 % of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7 % of women treated with a comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator .
The observed excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 100 patient years of use .
28 In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study , 44/ 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone .
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action , pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation .
These patients may be at risk of pregnancy .
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs , the treatment should be discontinued ( see section 4.6 ) .
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors ( e. g. gemfibrozil ) or inducers ( e. g. rifampicin ) .
Glycaemic control should be monitored closely .
Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered ( see section 4.5 ) .
Actos tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea .
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450 , 1A , 2C8/ 9 and 3A4 .
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes , e. g. oral contraceptives , cyclosporin , calcium channel blockers , and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected .
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone .
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related adverse events , a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
Co- administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to result in a 54 % decrease in AUC of pioglitazone .
The pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered .
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
There are no adequate human data to determine the safety of pioglitazone during pregnancy .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in pregnancy .
Pioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats .
It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk .
Therefore , pioglitazone should not be administered to breast-feeding women .
29 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed .
Adverse reactions reported in excess ( > 0.5 % ) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients receiving pioglitazone in double-blind studies are listed below as MedDRA preferred term by system organ class and absolute frequency .
Frequencies are defined as : very common > 1/ 10 ; common > 1/ 100 , , 1/ 1000 ,
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH METFORMIN Blood and lymphatic system disorders
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH SULPHONYLUREA Ear and labyrinth disorders
31 PIOGLITAZONE IN TRIPLE ORAL COMBINATION THERAPY WITH METFORMIN AND SULPHONYLUREA
PIOGLITAZONE IN COMBINATION THERAPY WITH INSULIN Metabolism and nutrition disorders
Oedema was reported in 6 9 % of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled clinical trials .
The oedema rates for comparator groups ( sulphonylurea , metformin ) were 2 5 % .
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment .
32 In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy was 2 3 kg over one year .
This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group .
In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg .
In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a mean weight loss of 1.0 kg .
Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents .
In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups .
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone .
Rare cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing experience .
Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported , causal relationship has not been established .
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo , metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups , but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin .
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease , the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6 % higher with pioglitazone than with placebo , when added to therapy that included insulin .
However , this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study .
Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone , but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure .
A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised , comparator controlled , double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration .
A higher rate of fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone ( 2.6 % ) versus comparator ( 1.7 % ) .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.3 % ) versus comparator ( 1.5 % ) .
In the 3.5 year PROactive study , 44/ 870 ( 5.1 % ) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 ( 2.5 % ) of female patients treated with comparator .
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone ( 1.7 % ) versus comparator ( 2.1 % ) .
Patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 45 mg daily .
The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/ day for four days , then 180 mg/ day for seven days was not associated with any symptoms .
Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin .
Symptomatic and general supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : oral blood glucose lowering drugs ; Thiazolidinediones ; ATC code :
Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance .
Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors ( peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma ) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals .
Treatment with pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of insulin resistance .
33 Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
The improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations .
A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure ( defined as appearance of HbA1c 8.0 % after the first six months of therapy ) .
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients treated with gliclazide , compared with pioglitazone .
At two years , glycaemic control ( defined as HbA1c < 8.0 % ) was sustained in 69 % of patients treated with pioglitazone , compared with 50 % of patients on gliclazide .
In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin , glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year .
The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide .
In a placebo controlled trial , patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months .
Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45 % compared with those continuing on insulin alone , and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group .
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin sensitivity .
Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect .
In one year clinical trials , pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the albumin/ creatinine ratio compared to baseline .
The effect of pioglitazone ( 45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo ) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics .
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain .
Visceral fat was significantly decreased , while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass .
Similar changes in body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity .
In most clinical trials , reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo , with small , but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels .
In clinical trials of up to two years duration , pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids , and increased HDL cholesterol levels , compared with placebo , metformin or gliclazide .
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo , whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide .
In a 20-week study , as well as reducing fasting triglycerides , pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides .
These effects were independent of pioglitazone s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide .
In PROactive , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy , for up to 3.5 years .
The study population had an average age of 62 years ; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years .
Approximately one third of patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/ or a sulphonylurea .
To be eligible patients had to have had one or more of the following : myocardial infarction , stroke , percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft , acute coronary syndrome , coronary artery disease , or peripheral arterial obstructive disease .
Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 20 % had had a stroke .
Approximately half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria .
Almost all subjects ( 95 % ) were receiving cardiovascular medications ( beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II antagonists , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , diuretics , aspirin , statins , fibrates ) .
Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint , which was a composite of all-cause mortality , non- fatal myocardial infarction , stroke , acute coronary syndrome , major leg amputation , coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation , the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular
However , the incidences of oedema , weight gain and heart failure were increased .
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed .
Following oral administration , pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed , and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration .
Proportional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 60 mg .
Steady state is achieved after 4 7 days of dosing .
Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites .
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l/ kg .
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein ( > 99 % ) .
Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups .
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser degree .
Three of the six identified metabolites are active ( M-II , M-III , and M-IV ) .
When activity , concentrations and protein binding are taken into account , pioglitazone and metabolite M-III contribute equally to efficacy .
On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold that of pioglitazone , whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal .
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that pioglitazone inhibits any subtype of cytochrome P450 .
There is no induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A , 2C8/ 9 , and 3A4 in man .
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin , warfarin , phenprocoumon and metformin .
Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil ( an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) or with rifampicin ( an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8 ) is reported to increase or decrease , respectively , the plasma concentration of pioglitazone ( see section 4.5 ) .
Following oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man , recovered label was mainly in faeces ( 55 % ) and a lesser amount in urine ( 45 % ) .
In animals , only a small amount of unchanged pioglitazone can be detected in either urine or faeces .
The mean plasma elimination half-life of unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours .
Steady state pharmacokinetics are similar in patients age 65 and over and young subjects .
In patients with renal impairment , plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function , but oral clearance of parent substance is similar .
Thus free ( unbound ) pioglitazone concentration is unchanged .
Total plasma concentration of pioglitazone is unchanged , but with an increased volume of distribution .
Intrinsic clearance is therefore reduced , coupled with a higher unbound fraction of pioglitazone .
In toxicology studies , plasma volume expansion with haemodilution , anaemia , and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice , rats , dogs , and monkeys .
In addition , increased fatty deposition and infiltration were observed .
These findings were observed across species at plasma concentrations 4 times the clinical exposure .
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone .
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth .
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity assays .
An increased incidence of hyperplasia ( males and females ) and tumours ( males ) of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years .
There was no tumorigenic response in mice of either sex .
Hyperplasia of the urinary bladder was not seen in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 12 months .
In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , treatment with two other thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon .

Das vorliegende Dokument ist eine Zusammenfassung des Europäischen Öffentlichen Beurteilungsberichts ( EPAR ) , in dem erläutert wird , wie der Ausschuss für Humanarzneimittel ( CHMP ) die durchgeführten Studien beurteilt , um zu Empfehlungen bezüglich der Anwendung des Arzneimittels zu gelangen . It explains how the Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) assessed the studies performed , to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine .
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment , read the Package Leaflet ( also part of the EPAR ) or contact your doctor or pharmacist .
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations , read the Scientific Discussion ( also part of the EPAR ) .
Actraphane is a range of insulin suspensions for injection .
Actraphane is supplied in vials , cartridges ( PenFill ) or pre-filled pens ( NovoLet , FlexPen or InnoLet ) .
Actraphane contains the active ingredient insulin human ( rDNA ) .
Actraphane contains both fast-acting ( soluble ) and long-acting ( isophane ) insulin .
Actraphane 10 : soluble insulin 10 % and isophane insulin 90 % Actraphane 20 : soluble insulin 20 % and isophane insulin 80 % Actraphane 30 : soluble insulin 30 % and isophane insulin 70 % Actraphane 40 : soluble insulin 40 % and isophane insulin 60 % Actraphane 50 : soluble insulin 50 % and isophane insulin 50 %
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
Actraphane is given subcutaneously ( under the skin ) by injection , usually in the abdominal wall ( tummy ) .
If convenient it may also be given in the gluteal region ( bottom ) or the deltoid region ( shoulder ) .
The patient 's blood sugar should be tested regularly to find the lowest effective dose .
The usual dose is between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
Actraphane is usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more long-lasting effect is needed .
Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the blood sugar .
Actraphane is a replacement insulin which is identical to the insulin made by the pancreas .
Der wirksame Bestandteil von Actraphane , 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel. Actraphane contains insulin in two forms : the soluble form , which acts quickly ( within 30 minutes of injection ) and the isophane form which is absorbed much more slowly during 7 Westferry Circus , Canary Wharf , London E14 4HB , UK Tel .

The replacement insulin acts in same way as naturally produced insulin and helps glucose enter cells from the blood .
By controlling the blood sugar , the symptoms and complications of diabetes are reduced .
Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , when the pancreas cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , when the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
About one third of the patients had Type 1 diabetes ( the others had Type 2 diabetes ) .
The study compared Actraphane 30 to a similar mix , but made up using an insulin analogue ( insulin aspart ) .
The study measured after 12 weeks the level of a substance ( glycosylated haemoglobin , HbA1c ) , which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled .
What benefit has Actraphane shown during the studies ?
Actraphane led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c , indicating that blood sugar levels had been controlled to a similar level to that seen with other human insulin .
Actraphane was effective for both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes .
Actraphane may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood glucose ) .
For the full description of the side effects reported with Actraphane , please see the Package Leaflet .
Actraphane should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive ( allergic ) to insulin human ( rDNA ) or to any of the other ingredients .
Actraphane doses might also need to be adjusted when given with a number of other medicines which may have an effect on blood sugar ( the full list is available in the Package Leaflet ) .
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use ( CHMP ) decided that Actraphane s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of diabetes .
They recommended that Actraphane be given marketing authorisation .
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union , for Actraphane to Novo Nordisk A/ S on 7 October 2002.
The full EPAR for Actraphane can be found here .
For detailed conditions for the use of this product , scientific information or procedural aspects please refer to the relevant modules .
3 ml ( 3.5 mg/ ml )
10 ml ( 1.4 mg/ ml )
10 ml ( 3.5 mg/ ml )
Actraphane 30 40 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a vial .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 40 IU of insulin human .
1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 400 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
2 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
3 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
4 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
Studien haben eine t½ von etwa 5-10 Stunden ergeben . Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Actraphane 30 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a vial .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 1000 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
9 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
10 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask hispatients about any medicinal products they take .
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
11 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .

An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
23 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk delivery systems ( durable devices for repeated use ) and NovoFine needles .
Detailed instruction accompanying the delivery system must be followed .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
24 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
25 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
27 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
Studien haben eine t½ von etwa 5-10 Stunden ergeben . Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Actraphane 50 Penfill 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a cartridge .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 50 consists of 50 % dissolved insulin and 50 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
44 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk delivery systems ( durable devices for repeated use ) and NovoFine needles .
Detailed instruction accompanying the delivery system must be followed .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
45 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
46 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .

Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Actraphane NovoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine needles .
NovoLet delivers 2-78 units in increments of 2 units .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
59 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
60 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
62 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Actraphane 30 NovoLet 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
65 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
76 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Actraphane 50 NovoLet 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 50 consists of 50 % dissolved insulin and 50 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
79 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Actraphane NovoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine needles .
NovoLet delivers 2-78 units in increments of 2 units .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
80 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
81 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
