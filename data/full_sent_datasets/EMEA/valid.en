Actrapid contains the active substance insulin human ( rDNA ) .
Actrapid is used in patients who have diabetes .
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription .
Actrapid is administered subcutaneously ( under the skin ) by injection , usually into the abdominal wall ( tummy ) .
The thigh , the deltoid region ( shoulder ) or the gluteal region ( buttocks ) may also be used .
The patient 's blood glucose ( sugar ) should be tested regularly to find the lowest effective dose .
The usual dose is between 0.3 and 1.0 international units ( IU ) per kilogram body weight per day .
Actrapid is given 30 minutes before a meal .
Actrapid is a fast-acting insulin and may be used with long-acting insulins .
Actrapid may also be given intravenously ( into a vein ) but only by a doctor or a nurse .
Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the blood glucose .
Actrapid is a replacement insulin that is identical to the insulin made by the pancreas .
The active substance in Actrapid , insulin human ( rDNA ) , is produced by a method known as recombinant technology : the insulin is made by a yeast that has received a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it able to produce insulin .
The replacement insulin acts in same way as naturally produced insulin and helps glucose enter cells from the blood .
By controlling the blood glucose , the symptoms and complications of diabetes are reduced .
Durch Regelung des Blutzuckers werden die Symptome und Komplikationen von Diabetes verringert . Actrapid has been studied in patients with type 1 diabetes , when the pancreas cannot produce insulin ( two studies involving 1,954 patients ) , and type 2 diabetes , when the body is unable to use insulin effectively ( one study involving 182 patients ) .

HbA1c levels remained fairly steady over the six months of treatment with Actrapid .
As with all insulins , Actrapid may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood glucose ) .
For the full description of all side effects reported with Actrapid , see the Package Leaflet .
Actrapid should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive to insulin human ( rDNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
Actrapid doses might also need to be adjusted when given with a number of other medicines which may have an effect on blood glucose .
The full list is available in the Package Leaflet .

Actrapid is a fast-acting insulin and may be used in combination with long-acting insulin products .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
Eine Anpassung der Dosierung kann auch bei einer Änderung der körperlichen Aktivität oder der Ernährungsgewohnheiten des Patienten notwendig sein . Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
2 Administration For subcutaneous or intravenous use .
Actrapid may also be administered intravenously , which should only be carried out by health care professionals .
Actrapid is administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall .
The thigh , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale .
When two types of insulin are mixed , draw the amount of fast-acting insulin first , followed by the amount of long-acting insulin .
Actrapid is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actrapid , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actrapid
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
3 Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Due to the risk of precipitation in pump catheters , Actrapid should not be used in insulin pumps for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion .
Actrapid contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
Oral contraceptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actrapid dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actrapid , are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 , including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Uncommon - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Very rare - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
5 Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : insulins and analogues for injection , fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
A clinical trial in a single intensive care unit treating hyperglycaemia ( blood glucose above 10 mmol/ l ) in 204 diabetic and 1344 non-diabetic patients undergoing major surgery showed that normoglycaemia ( blood glucose 4.4 6.1 mmol/ l ) induced by intravenous Actrapid reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % versus 4.6 % ) .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 1.5-3.5 hours and the entire duration of action is approximately 7-8 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
