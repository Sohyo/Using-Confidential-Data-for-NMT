The compression ratio is a value used to describe the reduction in size of the data . For example a compression ratio of 5 means that the compressed archive is 1 / 5th the size of the original data .
The name of a file or folder in the archive .
To View a File in an Archive
A damaged archive can be impossible to extract , this can bring to a loss of data . For this reason you should test the archive integrity before deleting the original files .
Not all the archive types support the integrity testing , the following is the list of archive types that can be tested for integrity : 7-Zip , RAR , ZIP , ACE , ARJ and Zoo .
To test the integrity of an archive that doesn 't support the integrity testing , extract all the files from the archive and check that the operation is completed successfully .

An archive is composed of one or more files , along with metadata . It may be encrypted in part or as a whole . By collecting multiple data files together into a single one , archive files are useful for storing data and transferring it between computers .
Create new archive by adding files or folders
There are two ways of viewing the archive :
You may use these column headings mentioned above ( name , size ) … to sort the files in your archive . Do this by clicking on them , and click the same one again to sort in reverse order .
Open the file with different application by following these steps :

You can specify in the file chooser dialog whether you want :
Tick this option if you want to keep the directory structure , as it was in your archive
This option will not overwrite existing files with the same name , which have a more recent modification date than those which are in the archive .
Choose the location in the file chooser , into which the files should be extracted . This will be the destination folder .
The application will show you the progress bar in a new dialog . If the extraction completes successfully , you will be asked whether you want to :
A dialog will open . Enter the new file name into the text entry field .

Not all archive file formats support folders — if the file format that you are using does not , you will not be warned . If the file format that you are using does not support folders , the files from the folders will be added , but not the folder itself .
Once you finish adding files , the archive is ready ; you do not need to save it .
The application will show you the progress bar in a new dialog . If the extraction completes successfully , you will be asked whether you want to :

There must be a clear path from the original position of the object to the destination cell ( i.e you can not jump over objects ) .
A straight horizontal , vertical or diagonal line of five or more similar objects will disappear from the game board . When this happens you will have an extra move without additional objects being added to the board .
The game is over when the board is full , since no object can be moved at that point .
You score points by creating lines of 5 or more objects . The number of points depends on the number of objects that disappear .
Try to set at least three same objects with your every move .
Try to line up more than 5 objects . For example , if you have 6 objects , you can line up 2 and 3 with a space in between , and then connect them by placing the sixth object between them .

@ @ image : ' figures / verbal-games.png ' ; md5 = 6559e8d03907794b9983c5501df1aed2
To start a new game , do one of the following :
Click on one of the buttons in the toolbar .
Starts a new game playing all the available game types .
Start a new game playing only logic games .
Starts a new game playing only calculation games .
Starts a new game playing only memory games .
Starts a new game playing only verbal analogy games .
When you play a game , always read the instructions carefully !
The game session begins by showing you the problem and then asking for the answer . At the bottom of the window is the main set of controls that you can use to interact with the game .
@ @ image : ' figures / gbrainy.png ' ; md5 = d3b523ab1c8d00d00560d3f036d681bb
It features different game types like logic puzzles , mental calculation games , memory trainers and verbal analogies , designed to test different cognitive skills .
If you answer a puzzle incorrectly , you will not get any score for it .
If you answer a puzzle correctly , you will get a score which depends on the time taken to resolve the problem and whether you used the tip during the game .
The following table summarizes the different game durations ( in seconds ) based on the difficulty level .
With the expected time for the chosen difficulty level and the time you take to complete the game , the following logic is applied :
If you take less than the time expected to complete the game , you score 10 points .
If you take more than the time expected to complete the game , you score 8 points .
If you take more than 2x the time expected to complete the game , you score 7 points .
If you take more than 3x the time expected to complete the game , you score 6 points .
If you use a tip , you score only the 80 % of the original score .
This means that when playing at medium difficulty level , to get a score of 100 points you need to score 10 points on at least 20 games of every game type played .
This may sound challenging , but it allows players to compare game scores from different sessions ( in the player 's game history ) and allows better tracking of the progression of the player through all of the games played .
To select the results that will be shown in the graphic , use the different check boxes located under the graph .
In order to change the number of sessions recorded or how many games will be stored in the history , proceed as follows :
Use the first spin box to change how many game sessions need to be recorded before you can start to see the results in the history graphic .
Use the second spin box to change how many game sessions will be shown in the history graphic .
To change the difficulty level of the game , proceed as follows :
Use the tips to solve a puzzle .
With some of the games you can play , it is possible to get simple tips that can help you to solve the problem .
This feature is not available for some of the games .
To pause a game so that you can resume it at the same point at a later time , perform one of the following :
In order to resume the game after you paused it , perform one of the following :
To end a game , perform one of the following :

Games designed to challenge your reasoning and thinking skills . These games are based on sequences of elements , visual and spatial reasoning or relationships between elements .
Games based on arithmetical operations designed to improve your mental calculation skills . Games that require the player to use multiplication , division , addition and subtraction combined in different ways .
Games designed to challenge your short-term memory . These games show collections of objects and ask the player to recall them , sometimes establishing relationships between figures , words , numbers or colors .
Games that challenge your verbal aptitude . These games ask the player to identify cause and effect , use synonyms or antonyms , and use their vocabulary .
To do so , proceed as follows :
Every hour rotates 360 degrees .
Out of [ people ] people , [ brothers ] have brothers , [ sisters ] have sisters and [ both ] have both . How many people have neither brothers nor sisters ?
