Work with your mail while not being connected to the network .
Offline mode helps you communicate with remote mail storage systems like GroupWise , IMAP or Exchange , in situations where you are not connected to the network at all times . Evolution keeps a local copy of one or more folders to allow you to compose messages , storing them in your Outbox to be sent the next time you connect .
POP mail downloads all messages to your local system , but other connections usually download just the headers , and get the rest only when you want to read the message . Before you go offline , Evolution downloads the unread messages from the folders you have chosen to store .
To mark a mail folder for offline use ,
Evolution automatically understands the network state and acts accordingly . For instance , Evolution switches to offline mode when the network goes down and automatically switches on when the network is up again . Ensure that your system has Network Manager installed on to enable this feature .

Sorting the message list of a mail folder .
Evolution lets you organize your emails by letting you sort messages .
This feature , when enabled , groups replies with the original email and allows you to follow the flow of the conversation from one message to the next .
When a new message arrives , it will be added below the parent message . Threads are sorted and displayed based on the date of the most recent message received .
For Advanced Users : There is a GConf key that allows you to toggle between the collapsed and expanded state of the email threads . The collapsed state is enabled by default and may be modified at / apps / evolution / mail / display / thread _ expand .
The message list displays columns that indicate whether a message has been read , whether it has attachments , how important the message is , the sender , date , and the subject . To change the columns used in the message list , you can do one of the following :
Right-click on the header .
Evolution allows you to sort your messages using these columns . Just click on the column label to sort the emails . The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates the direction of the sort .
Evolution provides other ways for sorting email messages . You can use Sort By , Sort Ascending , Sort Descending , or Unsort .

Free webmail providers often supply information about which of these options can be used . If you are in an organizational environment , you may want to contact your system administrator for more information .

In the mail view , you can quickly search for messages by defining conditions .
Select the scope from the drop-down list right to the text box .
If you start directly from the fourth step , text will be searched in mail 's subjects and addresses and scope will be " Current folder " .
There currently is no way to do search for emails with a specific type of attachment ( for example searching for all emails that have a PDF attachment ) .
It might happen that one of your Search folders has not updated since some new email arrived or since an email was deleted , for example . This will mean that the list of emails in the folder is not up-to-date .
Use search folders to see messages in one folder while still keeping them in their original folders .
Evolution automatically updates the search folder contents when new messages are received or message are deleted .
The sender 's email address or the name of the sender .
Only the BCC recipients of the message . Obviously this can only be applied to outgoing filters .
The sender 's email address or the name of the sender or the recipients of the message .
If a message uses a header more than once , Evolution pays attention only to the first instance , even if the message defines the header differently the second time . For example , if a message declares the Resent-From : header as " engineering @ example.com " and then restates it as " marketing @ example.com " , Evolution filters as though the second declaration did not occur . To filter on messages that use headers multiple times , use a regular expression .
Searches in the actual text of the message .
Filters messages according to the date on which they were sent . First , choose the conditions you want a message to meet , such as before a given time or after a given time . Then choose the time . The filter compares the message 's time stamp to the system clock when the filter is run , or to a specific time and date you choose from a calendar . You can also have it look for a message within a range of time relative to the filter , such as two to four days ago .
This works the same way as the Date Sent option , except that it compares the time you received the message with the dates you specify .
Sets the message score to any whole number greater than 0 . You can have one filter set or change a message score , and then set up another filter to move the messages you have scored . A message score is not based on anything in particular : it is simply a number you can assign to messages so other filters can process them .
Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes .
Filters according to the status of a message . The status can be Replied To , Draft , Important , Read , or Junk .
Checks whether there is an attachment for the email .
Filters based on the mailing list the message came from . This filter might miss messages from some list servers , because it checks for the X-BeenThere header , which is used to identify mailing lists or other redistributors of mail . Mail from list servers that do not set X-BeenThere properly are not be caught by these filters .
