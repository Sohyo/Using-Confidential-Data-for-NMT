The menu bar contains commands for managing plugins , managing and using bookmarks , refreshing the accessible tree view , and accessing this help system .
The accessible tree view allows to view all of the accessibles starting at the desktop level . Selecting an accessible makes it available for further inspection using the loaded plugins .
You can drag plugins to or from this area just like the right plugin view .
Select an accessible through the tree view .
Use the tree view to navigate the hierarchy of accessible objects rooted at desktop . Unfolding a tree node reveals its immediate children while folding it hides them . Each node shows an icon for its associated application or widget role and its accessible name , if available . The second column lists how many nodes will be shown if the item is unfolded .
Bookmarks to accessibles in Accerciser are defined by an application name and a " path " in the application 's internal accessible hierarchy to the bookmarked accessible . When the target application is in a different state ( ie. multiple top level frames ) the path might not be correct .
This plugin displays information about the available interfaces for the selected tree view accessible . Unsupported interfaces are grayed out . Various instruments for viewing and controlling an interface are available under each expander .
Interfaces that are supported by the selected accessible are shown as sensitive .
This plugin monitors the selected types of events from the selected tree view accessible , from the selected tree view application , or the entire desktop .
The bottom part of the event monitor window allows you to pick the type and source of events .
IPython Tab Enter acc t = acc.queryText ( )
This plugin shows the interfaces , methods , and attributes supported by the accessible selected in the tree view .
This plugin checks applications for accessibility problems and generates a report including the severity and description of the problems . The report links errors to documentation about how to remedy common problems . The plugin is extensible with test schemas that define rules for validation .

Application Tree View
The API Browser Plugin allows you to verify interfaces , methods , and properties of a target accessible widget in an application .
To run the API Browser Plugin , select an accessible widget in the Application Tree View . Double-clicking a widget highlights it in the application 's interface , so you can be sure whether a certain widget were the one you were looking for .
After that , select one of the widget 's interfaces in the combobox . All public methods of the selected interface will be listed in the plugin 's leftmost column . All public properties , with their corresponding values , will be listed in the plugin 's rightmost column .

The Event Monitor Plugin allows you to view AT-SPI events and match them with accessible widgets .
When you open the Event Monitor Plugin , you see a list of checkboxes representing all the different AT-SPI event classes covered by the plugin :
If you check a class , all of its event types will be monitored by the plugin . The classes are exposed as tree structures ; therefore , you can refine your selection by expanding them and checking only the event types you really care about .
Selecting only a few event types per monitoring gives you a clearer output .
For each incoming event , the Event Monitor Plugin indicates the source and the application . Activating the link for either of these items will cause it to become selected in the Application Tree View .

Accessibility is a core value that should touch all aspects of a Desktop Environment . To help achieve it in GNOME , some libraries were developed , such as ATK and AT-SPI . Though originated in GNOME , these libraries are now also used in other Desktop Environments . To learn more about Accessibility Libraries for GNU / UNIX systems , you can consult :

AisleRiot is a collection of over 80 card games programmed in GNOME 's scripting language , Scheme .
Use the mouse to move cards . Click a card and drag it somewhere . Release the mouse button to deposit the card .
If a card can be moved to the foundation ( s ) , you do not need to drag it . You can double-click on it and it will move . If a sequence of cards can be moved to the foundations , you can generally move the sequence as one move .
Double clicking a card will send it to a foundation , if that is possible . This is useful for cleaning up large numbers of cards at the end of a successful game .
A useful tip to know is that right-clicking on a face-up card which is partially obscured by a card laid over it will raise it so that you can see what it is .
Some games have options to change the way the game is played . For example Klondike can be played with either single card deals or three-card deals . In these games there is a separate menu with the game 's name . You can only change the rules of the game at the beginning of the game - the menu will be inactive during the game .
Fifty-four spaces in five rows of nine and a last row of seven . Deal cards face up one per space . The spaces should be considered as one continuous line , the rows simply arrange the tableau so all of it can be seen at once . Thus the rightmost space of a row is to be considered to the left of the leftmost space of the row below .
To remove all cards except one .
Cards are moved singly . Any card can be moved over another card of the same suit or rank that is in the space immediately to its left or three spaces to its left . The card that is covered is removed from play . All the cards ( if any ) in spaces to the right of the resulting gap are moved to the left one space so as to close the gap . Double-clicking causes the card to move three spaces , if possible , or failing that one space to the left .
This is a diffcult game . Try to find two or three cards of the same rank at or near the last row . Try not to remove any card of this rank . At the end you can move these cards onto each other to win .
Top left pile . The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau . Cards are dealt in batches of seven , one on every Tableau pile .
Four piles top right . To be built in suit and sequence , wrapping from King to Ace when necessary . One card is dealt on to the first Foundation pile . The other Foundation piles must be started with cards of the same rank .
Seven piles . Deal card face up in first pile . Place one card face down on all other piles . Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all the covered piles . Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile . Tableau can be built down in same colors . Groups of cards can be moved . Empty piles can only be filled by the next deal from the Stock .
Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color . Groups of cards in sequence and same color can be moved as a unit .
Each deal flips one card from the Stock to each pile of the Tableau . There are no redeals .
Foundations are built up in suit in sequence , wrapping from King to Ace when necessary . Cards in Foundations are still in play . Double clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible .
Each card in Foundation scores one point .
Try to build down in suit whenever possible . Try to score as many points as you can as this game is very hard to win .

Top left pile . The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau . Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste . Two redeals .
To be taken from Stock . Top card available for play .
Four piles top right . To be built up in suit from Ace to King . Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau .
Seven piles . Four rows , the first row is face down , the second row is face up , the third row is face down , and the fourth and final row is face up . Essentially Athena is the same as Klondike only the opening layout is different . Tableau can be built down in alternating colors . Builds of cards can be moved . Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King .
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color . Builds of cards can be moved . An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom .
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually . Top card in Waste is in play . When Stock is empty , move all cards in Waste back to the Stock , maintaining order . You can go through the deck three times .
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King . Cards in Foundations are still in play . Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible .
Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point .
Don 't give up the ship ! Try brute force methods when the game seems over . Sometimes a combination of using cards already in the Foundation and rearranging sequences will free up some needed cards .
Top left pile . All cards except the Aces are placed here at the start of play . Clicking on the Stock will deal one card to each of the four Reserve piles .
Four piles on top , to the right of Stock . Place an Ace on each Foundation to begin the game . The Foundation piles are to be built up regardless of suit .
Four piles placed underneath Foundations . Each time Stock is clicked , one card will be placed on each Reserve pile . Top card is available for play . Reserve cards can only be moved on to Foundations .
Play begins by dealing four cards to the Reserve . If possible , play cards on to the Foundation from the Reserve . Continue this process until no cards are left in stock and no more moves on to Foundation can be made . A similar game that is a bit easier is Scuffle .
Do you believe in Luck ? Although this game takes more skill to play than Clock , the skill involved entails paying attention . A great game for brainless play .
Six piles , deal card face up in first pile . Place one card face down on all other piles . Place one card face up on the first two piles then one card face down on all covered piles . Place three cards face up and the rest face down and so on . Repeat gradually revealing more cards each time until there are six rows with six cards . Tableau can be built down in alternating colors . Builds of cards can be moved . Empty piles can only be filled by Kings or group of cards starting with a King .
Single pile below the foundations on the left . The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing on to the Tableau and Reserve . Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste . One redeal .
Single pile to the right of the Stock . To be taken from Stock . Top card available for play .
Eight piles top right . To be built up in suit from Ace to King .
Two stacks of 9 cards each , with a single above both stacks . Cards that are not obscured are available for play to anywhere except empty tableau spaces .
Eight piles , four on each side of the reserve . A card is dealt to each tableau pile when the game starts . Build down in suit . Empty spaces can be filled with any card . Only one card can be moved at a time .
Cards in the Tableau are built down by suit . Only one card can be moved at a time . Empty slots can be filled with any card except from the reserve .
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually . Top card in Waste is in play . When Stock is empty , move all cards in Waste back to the Stock , maintaining order . You can go through the deck twice .
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King . Cards in the Foundations are no longer in play . Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible .
You can use empty spaces in the Tableau to move multiple cards . Be careful with Kings in the Reserve : the only way to remove them is by playing them to a Foundation on top of a Queen .
Four piles at top . To be built in suit from Ace to King . Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau .
Thirteen piles . Four cards are dealt face up on each pile . Kings are moved to the bottom of their respective piles .
The top card on each Tableau can be moved to another Tableau pile if it has a value of one lower than the top card on the second pile . Suit is not relevant . Empty Tableau piles cannot be filled .
Foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King . Cards in Foundations are still in play . Double clicking on a card in the Tableau will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible .
Each card moved to the Foundation scores one point .
Be careful not to bury low cards . Try to keep Tableau piles from emptying .
Four piles top right . Built from Ace to King in suit .
Four piles at top left . Each reserve can only hold one card .
Eight piles underneath the Foundation and Reserves . The cards are dealt face up on to the Tableau , with seven cards each in the first four slots and six cards each in the last four slots .
The Tableau is built down by suit . Only the top card or build of cards can be moved . A build of cards can only be moved if the number of cards in the build is equal or less than one more than the number of Reserve slots free . Empty spaces in the Tableau can only be filled with a King or a build starting with a King .
Foundations are built up by suit from Ace to King . Although cards in the Foundations are technically still in play , there really is no need as playing these cards are not in any way helpful .
Any top card in the Tableau can be placed in an empty Reserve slot . These cards are available for play back into the Tableau or on to a Foundation pile .
Each card placed on to the Foundation piles scores one point .
Move any card you can on to the Foundations as soon as possible . Leaving them around can only hinder your movement .
Four piles at top . One card is dealt face up in the first Foundation pile .
There are 18 Tableau piles arranged in three rows of six piles each . All cards are dealt face up and fanned , such that all cards are visible . The first five piles of each row start with three cards each . The sixth pile of each row starts with two cards each .
One random card has already been dealt to a Foundation pile . The rank of that card becomes the Base Card . The other three cards with the same rank can be moved to an empty Foundation . Foundations are built up in ascending order , matching suit . Cards can " wrap-around " from Queen to King to Ace to Two . Cards on the Foundations may not be moved back onto Tableau piles .
None of the Tableau piles can have more than three cards . The top card of each Tableau pile can be moved to any other Tableau pile if it matches suit and has a face value of one higher or one lower than the top card of the pile it is being moved to . Cards can " wrap-around " between King and Ace .
There is never a disadvantage in moving cards to the Foundations . Move as many as possible , as soon as possible .
Cards that have a rank one lower than the Base Card can be very difficult to move . Be careful where you place them .
Bear River can be won about one third of the time .
Four piles in the middle column . Four aces are placed here , one in each pile , before the shuffle . To be built from Ace to King . Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau .
Eight slots ( four to the left and four to the right of Foundations . ) Deal all cards face up and extended on to these eight piles so that there are six cards in each pile and all cards are showing .
Cards in the Tableau are built down regardless of suit . Only one card can be moved at a time . Empty piles can be filled with any single card .
Each card in the Foundation piles other than the original Aces scores one point .
Build evenly on to Foundations if possible . Try and get an empty slot .
Top left pile . All cards are placed here at beginning of play .
Nine piles in a 3x3 formation . Each Tableau pile is dealt one card face up .
Remove cards in pairs that add up to ten . Jacks , Queens and Kings are removed in pairs . Tens cannot be removed . All empty slots are automatically filled by the Stock .
Removing each pair of cards scores two points .
This is a pure luck game . Therefore , any strategy involved would have to do with increasing your luck .
Top left pile . The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau . There are no redeals .
Three piles to the right of Stock . One card is dealt into each of the Reserves every time the Stock is clicked .
Four piles on the top right . Foundations are built up in sequence regardless of suit .
Deal face up eight piles of three cards each .
Cards in the Tableau are built down regardless of suit . Cards can only be moved singly . An empty pile in the Tableau can not be filled .
Cards are flipped from the Stock on to the three Reserve piles , one card each per deal . Top card of each Reserve pile is available for play . Empty Reserve piles cannot be filled except with the next deal from Stock .
Foundation piles are built up regardless of suit from Ace to King . Cards in Foundation are no longer in play .
Never look backwards . Cards that are locked in backwards order are to be dealt with as soon as possible . Move as many cards from the Reserve on to the Tableau as you can , for Kings are hard to move .
All the cards are placed in the Stock at the beginning of the game . Cards are turned over one at a time to waste . No redeals .
To be taken from Stock . Can only hold one card which must immediately be played on to Tableau .
Four by four grid , each capable of holding one card . Kings can only be placed in a corner space . Queens can only be placed in the middle two spaces of first and last row . Jacks can only be placed in the middle two spaces of first and last column .
Remove all cards but picture cards ( Jacks , Queens , and Kings ) . You have won if your Tableau looks like this --
-- and your Stock and Waste are empty . The suits do not matter .
There are two phases to this game . Alternate between the two phases until game is lost or won . Start with Phase One until Tableau is completely filled . At that point , move to Phase Two . Please note that you cannot begin Phase Two unless the Tableau is completely filled . At any point , you can return to Phase One , but remember that you cannot go back to Phase Two unless the tableau is once again filled . An exception to this rule is if the stock and waste are empty .
Phase One -- Click on the Stock to move a card into the empty Waste pile . If card is a :
King : Place in one of the empty four corner spaces .
Queen : Place in one of the empty middle two spaces of the top or bottom row .
Jack : Place in any of the empty middle two spaces of the leftmost or rightmost column .
Any other card : Place in any empty space .
Phase Two -- Remove 10 's singly by clicking on them . Remove pairs that add up to 10 by dragging one card on top of its pair .
Game is lost if a picture card cannot be put in an appropriate spot or if all the spaces are filled and no cards can be removed .
It is always safest in the middle . During Phase One of play , deal in the middle before going to the edges . If you see a possible pair , place that card on the edge so as to free more edge spaces during Phase Two of play .
Top left pile . The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing . Cards are turned over three at a time to Waste . Unlimited redeals .
Directly to the right of Stock . To be taken from Stock . Top card available for play .
On left under stock . Deal thirteen cards here with top card face up . Top card available for play to Foundations or Tableau .
Four piles below Foundations . Deal one card face up on to each pile . Tableau can be built down in alternating color . Groups of cards can be moved .
Four piles top right . Deal one card face up on first Foundation pile . This card is now the base card . Built up by suit .
Cards in the Tableau are built down by alternating color . Groups of cards can be moved . An empty slot in the Tableau is filled automatically from the Reserve . If the Reserve is empty , an empty slot can be filled by any card or group of cards in sequence .
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste by three . If the last flip has less than three cards , that many cards are flipped for that move only . When Stock is empty , move all cards in Waste back to the Stock , maintaining order .
Foundations are built up in suit from the base card ( first card dealt to first Foundation ) New Foundations are started when a card of the same rank as the first card placed during the dealing period are placed on empty Foundation piles . Aces are placed on Kings , and twos on Aces . Cards in Foundations are still in play . Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible .
Each card in the Foundation piles scores one point . This game used to be played in casinos . You would break even if your score is 10 .
A bird in hand is worth two in the bush . This game is hard to win . Most people play with the betting rules in mind and try to get as many points as possible . To this end , always move cards into the Foundations as soon as they are available .
Top left pile . The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing . Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste . No redeals .
Four piles top right . To be built up in suit from Ace to King . Aces are removed before dealing and placed on the foundations .
The " Carpet " . Four rows of five cards dealt face up . Cards on the tableau are available for play . There is no building . Empty spaces are automatically filled from the waste if possible or the stock .
Cards on the tableau are in play .
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually . Top card in Waste is in play . There are no redeals .

Deal cards in a clock shape , for a total of twelve piles with four cards each .
Place last four cards in the Stock pile ( middle of the Tableau ) Flip over top card .
To have all four cards in each pile be the rank corresponding to the number on a clock face .
Move the top card in the middle to the appropriate pile . The Tableau is in the shape of a clock , and so the numbered cards go where they would on an analog clock . Aces go where the ones go , and the Jacks and Queens go where the elevens and twelves go respectively . For all the people who have never had an analog watch / clock , this is the pattern :
Kings are kept in the middle pile . When a card is moved to a new pile ( or made to stay in the same pile , as the case is with the King ) , the bottom card in the new pile is taken and placed on top of the middle pile face up . This new card is ready for play . To move a card to the appropriate pile , either drag the card over or double click on the appropriate receptor pile .
Game is over when there are four kings in the middle . At this point , you 've won if goal is achieved . Note that if a card in a pile is in the right place it is okay even if it is faced down .
Each card in the appropriate pile of the clock ( not counting Kings , as there are no Kings on real clocks ) scores one point .
Find a way to automate this game . There are no decisions ever to be made . If you lose it 's not your fault . ( Contrariwise , if you win , it 's just luck ! )

Up to thirteen piles , dealt four cards at a time until the stock is exhausted . Tableau piles can be built down in suit .
Build foundations up in suit and tableau piles down in suit . If no moves are available ( or you just feel like it ) , click on the empty top left slot for a redeal .
Redeals are accomplished by placing the tableau piles on top of each other in order , starting from the last pile . Then the deck is simply turned over and redealt , four cards at a time , back to the tableau . If no moves are made , redealing will not alter the arrangement of the cards . Therefore , the game is lost if no move is possible immediately after a redeal .
Note : a degenerate case occurs whenever , after a redeal , the last tableau pile contains only one card and the only move possible is from the final tableau pile one before it . Making this move and redealing only results in the original card arrangement . AisleRiot will end the game if this situation is detected .
Each card placed in the foundation piles scores one point .
If more than one pile on the tableau can be built upon , choose to build upon the one with the highest rank first .

Cards in the Reserve piles cannot be rearranged .
Seven piles on the bottom . Deal one card face down on all seven piles , then one on the last six piles , followed by one on the last five piles . Continue in this manner until you have seven cards in the last pile . Flip up the top card on every pile .
Top left pile . Deck placed here after dealing onto Tableau . Clicking deals one card face up to every pile .
The deck is a standard double deck . There are two complete sequences of cards for each suit . This is the standard Spider deck . It is also the most difficult .
Many traditional implementations of Spider do not use a foundation and simply remove completed sequences of cards . This has no impact upon game play .
A sequence of thirteen cards can be moved to a foundation pile . Once there , these cards are no longer in play .
Four piles on top right . Deal one two on each Foundation pile to start . To be built up in suit to Ace .
Pile under Stock . Deal thirteen cards here to begin . Top card available for play on to Tableau or Foundation piles .
Cards in the Tableau are built down in suit . Groups of cards can be moved . An empty slot in the Tableau is filled automatically from the Reserve . If the Reserve is empty , an empty slot can be filled by the top card of the Waste at your leisure .
Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste . Top card is available for play . There are two redeals
Foundations are built up in suit from twos to aces . Cards in Foundations are no longer in play . Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible .
Each card moved to Foundation piles scores one point .
No point lagging behind ! Move cards to Foundation piles whenever possible .
Four piles in the middle column . To be built from Ace to King . Topmost card in each Foundation can be played back on to the Tableau .
Only a King may be moved to a blank tableau spot .
You win or lose . There is no scoring .
This game is hard to win ( being very influenced by how the cards are placed to begin with ) . Don 't forget you have the temporary spots . Try to clear them quickly because they are very useful when you get stuck .
Top left pile . The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Reserve and on to the Tableau . Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste . Stock cannot be turned .
To be taken from the Stock . Top card available for play .
Eleven cards dealt face up in a pile . All cards are visible but only top card is in play .
Eight piles in the middle . To be built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card .
Nine cards dealt face up from the deck once based card is selected .
Cards are flipped from the Stock to the Waste individually as many times as you like unless there is a space in the tableau . If there is a space in the tableau then only one card may be flipped from the stock to the waste until the tableau is filled or the top card of the waste is moved to the foundation or tableau . While the stock is locked you can still move cards around on the tableau , from the reserve and to the foundation . If the Waste is empty a card from the Stock is automatically dealt . Top card in Waste is in play . Stock cannot be turned .
Double clicking on a card will move it to the appropriate Foundation pile if such a move is possible .
There are seven ways to play . The difference between them is in number of Reserve cards , Tableau piles or choice of Base Card .
Reserve of 11 cards , 9 Tableau piles . Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card . User selection of the base card from a choice of four at the start of the game and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile . Stock cannot be turned .
Reserve of 13 cards , 9 Tableau piles . Foundations are built up in sequence by suit from the base card . User selection of the base card from a choice of four at the start of the game and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile . Stock can be turned once but the game is lost if you cannot play each new card after its turned .
Reserve of 11 cards , 9 Tableau piles . Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card . At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile . Stock cannot be turned .
Reserve of 11 cards , 9 Tableau piles . Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card . At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile . Spaces in the Tableau are automatically filled from the Waste or Stock if the Waste is empty . Stock cannot be turned .
Reserve of 21 cards , 8 Tableau piles . Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card . At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile . Spaces in the Tableau are automatically filled from the Reserve or any card if the Reserve is empty . Stock cannot be turned .
Reserve of 10 cards , 8 Tableau piles . Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card . At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile . Stock cannot be turned .
Reserve of 10 cards , 9 Tableau piles . Foundations are built up in sequence by alternating colours from the base card . At the start of the game a base card is selected automatically and one card is dealt to each Tableau pile . Stock cannot be turned .
Watch for reversed sequences in the Stock , Reserve a Foundation to remove each reversed sequence .
Try to start Tableau piles from the last card needed to complete a Foundation .
Remember that you can continue to flip cards from the stock while it is locked without filling the tableau by using the top card of the waste .
Seven piles of five cards each , face up .
The Waste can be built up or down from the available cards on the Tableau . Jokers are wild and can be played on any rank as well as be played upon by a card of any rank .
At any point , a card can be dealt from the Stock to the Waste .
The following table shows the points you receive for each type of card . No points are scored for jokers .
To be taken from Stock . The top card is available for play .
Seven piles . Deal card face up in first pile . Place one card face down on all other piles . Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all covered piles . Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile . Tableau can be built down in any suit but own . Groups of cards can be moved . Empty piles can be filled by any legal sequence of cards .
Cards in the Tableau are built down by any suit but own . Groups of cards can be moved . An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a any legal sequence of cards .
Cards are flipped from the stock to the Waste individually . Top card in Waste is in play . When Stock is empty , move all cards in Waste back to the Stock , maintaining order . You can go through the deck three times .
To be taken from Stock . Top card and bottom card available for play .
Cards can be flipped singly from Stock to the top of Waste .
Foundation piles are to be built in suit from Ace to King , followed by another King , then back down to Ace , giving 26 cards per pile when game is won . Cards in Foundation piles are no longer in play .
Cards can be flipped singly from the Stock to the Waste . Top card of Waste is available for play . There is no redeal .
Top right pile . Can only hold one card .
Four piles . One card is dealt in each slot at the beginning of the game . Redealing from the stock moves all cards currently in the Tableau to the bottom of the Stock slot .
Four piles on top row . To be built up in suit from Ace to King .
Foundation piles are to be built up in suit from Ace to King . Cards in Foundation are no longer in play .
Each card moved to Foundation scores one point .
Seven piles . Deal all cards face up such that there is one card in the first pile , two in the second pile , ending with seven in the seventh pile .
Cards in the Tableau are built down by same color . Builds of cards that are the same suit and in sequence can be moved as a unit . Empty Tableau slots can be filled with any card or build of cards .
Top left pile . When clicked , deal a card on to every Tableau pile except for the last deal which places one card on each of the first three piles .
Seven piles on the bottom . Deal two cards face down and one card face up on every pile .
Seven piles . Deal card face up in first pile . Place one card face down on all other piles . Place one card face up on next pile followed by one card face down on all covered piles . Repeat until there are seven cards in last pile . Deal the rest of the cards face up on the second to seventh piles . To be built down in opposite color .
Cards in Tableau are built down in opposite color . Groups of cards can be moved regardless of sequence . A faced-down card is flipped when it is unburied . An empty pile in the Tableau can be filled with a King or a group of cards with a King on the bottom .
Top left pile . The rest of the deck is placed here after dealing the Tableau . Cards are turned over one at a time to Waste . One redeal .
Stock is dealt on to Waste singly . Top card of Waste is available for play . There is one redeal .
Foundations are built up by alternate color from Aces to Kings . Cards in Foundation piles are no longer in play .
There are very few second chances in the real world , so use them when you find them . Chances are you will need to use the second deal to win this game . Remember where the key cards are and you 'll be glad you did .

You can also set landscaped or portrait page layout and the paper size , page orientation and paper type . Remember to set them up properly according to your printer , otherwise printing may not look correct .
The neat thing is that Anjuta does not store any project information beyond what is already available in the project structure . That is , there is no separate project data maintained by Anjuta and all project processing is done directly within the project structure . This allows a project to be maintained or developed outside Anjuta without any need to convert to or from an Anjuta-specific format . Since technically Anjuta projects are just automake projects , mixed development ( with both Anjuta and non-Anjuta users ) or switching back and forth between Anjuta and other tools is quite possible without any hindrance .

In addition some syntax might be too complex for the integrated parser and it might not be able to detect which completion is required
As it is usually quite hard to remember the signature of every method or function used in a project , the editor will automatically display a small tooltip whenever you type ' ( ' after a function name and show you the signature .

Configure and use automatic indentation for a consistent coding style
The big disadvantage of manually configuring indentation is that all developers working on a project must use the same settings or it will result if different styles used in the same files . For a better solution , see the next section .
Unless explicitely changed in the preferences the indentation settings found in the Modeline of a file will be used instead of the configured settings to keep the file consistent .
Modelines are used to help editors to automatically detect the indentation mode which should be used for a particular file . They are especially useful if many developers work on the same project and use different environments .
The symbol browser allows you to get an overview over the symbols used in your project . Symbols refers to variables , functions / methods and classes here and the exact definition depends on the programming language used .

There are different types of target available .
It represents a library shared by several programs which is linked at run time . It is the most common kind of libraries on Linux . It is called dynamic link library on Windows .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name must start with ' lib ' and has the ' .la ' extension .
It represents a library , often named a plugin , linked at run time explicitely by the program itself . It is used to only load the code corresponding to the used features .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name does not need the ' lib ' prefix but must have the ' .la ' extension .
It represents a library linked with the program at compile time . Only the function used are kept inside the generated executable .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name must start with ' lib ' and has the ' .a ' extension .
It represents compiled program by example from C souces files . All children represent the source files compiled to generate the program .
This target allows you to group header files and define where they have to be installed .
It groups man pages needed by the project .
It groups info page needed by the project .
It groups data files which needed by the project like pictures , ui description , settings files ...
It represents program those are scripts . Those scripts are only installed in the specified directory . If scripts are generated additional rules are needed .
A target is a file created from source files . Typically , it is a program or a library , but it could also be documentation if the documentation needs processing , for example .
The build command compiles all needed source files , and possibly links them with some other files , like libraries , in order to create the target . If some source files are already compiled and haven 't been modified , they are not be recompiled , in order to save time . There are several ways to trigger a build .
It can be useful to delete all files created by the build process . For example , if all dependencies are not taken into account and a modified file does not trigger a recompiling as it should , deleting all files will fix this . There are several ways to do this
Most programming languages allow you to compile an individual source file . It reads the file , checks for errors and convert into an intermediate object file . Most errors happens in this step , so it is useful to compile a file after modifying it to check for errors . There are several ways to do it .

You can have several configurations having their own options and build directory , this text box allows to name them . Typically you have already defined a Default configuration , a Debug configuration making programs easier to debug ( keeping intermediate variables and code ordering ) and an Optimized configuration generating faster programs but increasing build time . You can define additional custom configurations .
Select here the build directory . It can be the project directory or a subdirectory . This is particularly useful when switching between different configurations to avoid rebuilding the whole project .
With autotools , you cannot have one configuration using a different directory if you already have one configuration using the project directory . You need to remove it first .
Some autotools project cannot be built outside the project directory . You can still use different configurations but they all have to use the project directory and everything will be recompiled on each change of the configuration .
This text box list all command line arguments used by the configure step . All arguments are separated by spaces and must be quoted if they contains a space . Each configuration fills this text box with default values that you can modify .
Before compiling and building files , an autotools project has to be configured . This step is needed to set global options , to check that all required libraries and programs are installed on your system and to generate appropriate build scripts .
The configuration could fail if some libraries or programs are not installed or do not have the right version . The error message tell you what is missing .
If the project has not been already configured , it will be automatically configured before building any file .
It is a like cleaning the project but it removes even more files . You need to re-configure your project to build it afterward .
There are several possibilities to install targets or a project .
This plugin is targeted at autotools projects but as they use make it is useful for other kind of projects using make .
Here is a list of the targets used by the plugin . They are implemented in all autotools projects but you need to implement them if you use a custom makefile .
Use to compile an source file . The object file name is found by replacing the source file extension with the corresponding object extension .
Use to build all targets in a directory .
Use to install all targets in a directory .
Use to delete all file built in a directory .
Use to build a distributation package , called only in the project directory .
As make comes with default rules allowing it to compile and link a C program without needing a makefile . You can compile a C program from a single source file without a makefile nor a project .
The dialog allows you to set global options for building files .
Errors and warnings during the build are displayed and highlighted in the message window . By checking this option , they are highlighted in the editor too .
This is the position of the breakpoint . For an existing breakpoint , you cannot change this . You can set a breakpoint at a certain line number , or at the beginning of a function . Use one of the following formats :
The debugger can also skip the breakpoint a certain number of times before breaking . If the pass count is not zero , then the debugger will have to encounter the breakpoint this number of times before breaking .
The pass count has a higher priority than the condition . Only when the pass count has been reached will the debugger evaluate the condition if it is present and break the program 's execution .
Breakpoints are used to stop the execution of the program at a particular point so that the state of the program can be examined at those locations .
This is the position of the breakpoint in the source file . When the breakpoint is set by the debugger , you can get additional information such as the function containing the breakpoint .
This field is filled with the address of the breakpoint when it is set by the debugger .
This is the breakpoint condition . It is empty if no condition is defined .
When the debugger is not running , this column displays the pass count of the breakpoint , or zero if it is not defined .
When the debugger is running , if the pass count is zero , this column displays the number of times this breakpoint has been triggered . If the pass count is not zero , both numbers are displayed . The pass count is the second number .
This is the state of the breakpoint . It may be
the breakpoint is not set in your program .
the breakpoint is set ( its id number is displayed in parentheses ) .
the breakpoint is set but will be deleted if reached .
All breakpoints are kept across Anjuta sessions even if they correspond to a non-existing locations , for example in a source file of a shared library not loaded yet . In this case their states are set as pending .
main menu Debug Add Breakpoint ... Breakpoint Add Breakpoint ...
Another solution is to use the toggle breakpoint function . If there is no breakpoint on the current line , it will add one . Otherwise , it will remove it .
main menu Debug Toggle Breakpoint Editor Toggle Breakpoint
You can 't change the location of a breakpoint ; create a new breakpoint instead . However , you can change the break condition or the pass count . To edit a breakpoint :
You can remove a breakpoint using the toggle breakpoint function described above . However , if you want to remove more than one breakpoint or the breakpoint is in a different file than the one you are editing , you can use the breakpoint window :
main menu Debug Remove All Breakpoints Breakpoint Remove All Breakpoints
Sometimes you might want to disable a breakpoint temporarily instead of deleting it altogether . To disable or re-enable a breakpoint :
main menu Debug Disable All Breakpoints Breakpoint Disable All Breakpoints
Registers whose values have changed since the last stop are in red . It is possible to change the value of any register by clicking in the value column and entering a new value .
The first column displays memory addresses in hexadecimal , the second displays memory contents in hexadecimal and the last column shows memory contents in ASCII .
The first column displays addresses in hexadecimal . In the second column , you can have a label starting at the beginning of the line and ending with a colon or a assembly-language instruction indented by 4 space characters .
The position in the disassembly window will be changed to the program counter value when the program is stopped .
You can send a custom command to the debugger like this :
The output of the command is displayed in the message window used by the debugger .
While you are debugging a program , you can find out the value of an expression or variable while the program is paused . It is also sometimes useful to change the value of a variable .
main menu Debug Inspect / Evaluate ... Editor Inspect / Evaluate ...
The debugger can tell you various information about the program while it is running .
This opens a window which will list all shared libraries the program has loaded and their locations in memory . It also shows whether each library 's symbol table is loaded or not .
This lists all available signals with a small description and three columns to specify what to do when a signal is received :
The debugger stops the program execution when the program receives this signal .
The debugger passes the signal to the program .
The context menu that is displayed when you click the right mouse button has all its items disabled because the corresponding functions are not implemented yet .
All local variables are displayed in a tree view with children used to represent structure or array members .
This hides command paths in the process list if checked .
This hides the command line arguments in the process list if checked .
If unchecked , the processes are displayed in a list . If checked , the processes are displayed in a tree .
The debugger can be used on an already running application .
The debugger can be used to debug an application running on another computer connected through a TCP or serial connection .
The debugger and the program can be stopped at any time like this :
A stack frame is the area of the stack associated to each function call . It lists all functions and their arguments in the sequence they were called . Each stack frame is numbered starting from 0 for the current function . You can only view the stack frames while the debugger is running .
Moreover , a program can be composed of several threads . Each thread is executed independently and has its own registers , stack and local variables , but shares all global variables .
The stacks are displayed in a tree view having their corresponding thread as parent and displaying the following information :
This contains a yellow arrow to represent the active stack frame . By default it is frame 0 , the current function . All evaluations and local variables are relative to this active frame . You can change the active stack frame to examine local variables in other functions .
This is a number corresponding to each thread .
The name of the file containing the function corresponding to this frame .
The line number of the function corresponding to this frame .
The name of the function corresponding to this frame .
The address of the function corresponding to this frame .
Clicking on a stack frame in the same thread changes only the stack frame , allowing to see other local variables . But doing it in another thread will change both the stack frame and the thread . The register values will be different and the debugger will restart in the selected thread .
Like a video editing session , the program can be executed in slow motion with the ability to go forward , pause , stop , and so on . This is essential for tracking program behavior . You cannot go backward yet , though .
Single stepping executes only one statement of the program ( from the place where it has stopped ) and then returns control . If the statement that is executed contains one function , the debugger tries to step inside the functions ( in the sequence in which the functions are executed ) . Once the statement is executed and control is passed back , you can study your program 's state .
Stepping over is similar to stepping except that it does not stop inside any function in the statement being executed .
main menu Debug Step Out Shift F5 Step Out
Stepping out executes the current function until it returns to the calling function .
This command restarts the program and lets it run until a breakpoint is encountered or the program exits .
main menu Debug Run to Cursor F8 Run to
This interrupts the program and returns control to the debugger , allowing you to perform debugging tasks , like inspecting data or adding breakpoints .
Use the program until the critical error occurs .
The top function with frame number 0 is in GLib , so you have to look down in the stack . Typically the error originates from the topmost function that belongs to your program .
Like local variables , all watch expressions are displayed in a tree with children used to represent structure or array members .
The name of the variable or the expression .
The type of the variable or of the expression result .
Watch expressions can be updated automatically as soon as the program is stopped or on user request .
To set a watch expression to update automatically :
To update all watch expressions manually at once :
To add an expression to the watch list :
main menu Debug Add Watch ... Watches Add Watch ...
An expression can be evaluated and then added as a watch like this :
main menu Debug Inspect / Evaluate Editor Inspect / Evaluate
You can remove an expression from the watches list .
All watches can be removed at the same time .
If a watch expression corresponds to a variable , you can change its value .
It is not possible to add or change anything with a project using this backend . But if you create a source file in the project directory , with the right extension , it will be added automatically .
/ * - * - Mode : C ; indent-tabs-mode : t ; c-basic-offset : 4 ; tab-width : 4 - * - * /
Number of space characters corresponding to one tabulation character .
Number of space characters used to indent C code .
/ * vim : set noet ts = 4 sw = 4 : * /
A makefile is probably the most common way to build software on all kinds of platforms . A makefile contains a list or rules describing which commands have to be run in order to generate a target from a list of dependencies . When building a program , the target is an object file and the dependencies are the source files . The target of one rule can be a dependency of another one , allowing several rules to be chained in order to make a final target .
If the project backend is not able to find all the source files , you can try to use the directory backend instead . It does not recognize any targets but should get all source files .
Changing properties , or adding or removing targets and source files are disabled with this backend , as automatically editing the makefile is not implemented . It has to be changed by hand using the text editor . When the makefile is saved , it is automatically reloaded though .
main menu File New Project from Existing Sources Project from Existing Sources New top tool bar
A folder allows you to group several target allowing to set common properties for all of them . It often corresponds to a directory .
Groups names are typically restricted to letters , digits and the underscore , so it 's safer to avoid other characters .
Add , edit or remove folders from a project .
Confirm the removal . This will only remove the folder from the project files without removing any files or directories from your disk .
In order to use a library in C , you need to tell the compiler where the header files are , and tell the linker where to find the needed libraries . The issue is that your program will not compile on another computer if the header and the libraries are elsewhere .
/ usr / include include _ path C preprocessor flags gcc
Linker flags library _ name gcc library _ name lib .a .so
Add a set of libraries to a target .
After creating a new module , you have to wait a few seconds while the project files are reloaded to see the new module in the list .
Packages cannot be added directly to a program but have to be grouped in a module .
You will get a list of all the packaged libraries installed on your system . You can check one or more libraries .
If the library you want does not appear here :
After selecting one library , a module name will be automatically generated but you can change it . You can select an already existing module name to add a new library to it and to all targets already using it .
Remove a set of libraries from a target .
Confirm the removal . This library will be removed from the target .
Confirm the removal . This package will be removed from the project file .
Whatever the underlying backend , the graphical interface is the same but some functions might be disabled .
You can add files in sub-directories of the project . Most project formats require the files to be under the project directory . Added source files outside the project directory are automatically copied inside to fulfill this requirement .
Add or remove files from a project .
Confirm the removal . The file will only be removed from the project , not from your disk .
A target groups files together and defines their use . It is used to represent a program , with all its source files as its children or only group data files those should be installed at the same place .
Enter a target name and select the type of the target in the drop-down list below . Depending on your project backend , various types of target are possible , see at the bottom .
Target names are typically restricted to letters , digits and the underscore , so it 's safer to avoid other characters .
Add , edit or remove targets from a project .
Confirm the removal . The target and all its properties will be removed from the project file . All its files stay untouched on your hard disk .
A project is represented by a tree , the root item corresponds to the project while children represent programs , libraries , directories and source files . Each item can have properties allowing to set more details like project version , compiler flags or installation directories . These item are divided in several categories , depending on the backend not all are available :
There is only one node of this kind . It represents the project itself . It is the place where you can set project wide properties like the project name or the project version .
You can drag and drop targets at the beginning of the project tree view to create a shortcut allowing to access them more easily . By default all program targets are already put here .
Leave the mouse over a project icon for a second and a small pop-up message will appear showing more information about this type of project .
Keep the mouse over the button or typing area for a second to get a small pop-up message with more details about the corresponding setting .
These are the command line arguments used by your program . The drop-down list keeps an history of the last arguments used .
The working directory is the current directory when your program will be run .
You can click on the drop-down section , to display all environment variables that will be accessible by your program . By default , it includes all the current environment variables , they are displayed in light gray .
When a variable has not the same value as in the current environment , it is displayed in black .
This has to be checked to run the program in a terminal allowing you to provide inputs and see its outputs using the standard Unix streams . It is not necessary for programs having a graphical interface .

Add or remove files from a project .
If the project backend supports it , you can add or remove files in your project without editing the project file .
The target allows you to group files , and has a type which defines how the files are used inside . A program target contains source files , which will be compiled to create the target . On the other hand , a data target only groups data files which will be installed in the same place .
Some project formats require the file to be under the project directory . Added source files outside the project directory are automatically copied inside to fulfill this requirement .
Confirm the removal . The file will only be removed from the project , not from your disk .

The name of the file containing the function corresponding to the current frame of the current thread .
The line number of the function corresponding to the current frame of the current thread .
The name of the function corresponding to the frame of the current thread .
The address of the function corresponding to the frame of the current thread .
The current thread is the thread whose stack and local variables are currently displayed in the debugger .

All local variables are displayed in a tree view with children used to represent structure or array members .
The debugger can tell you various information about the program while it is running .
This opens a window which will list all shared libraries the program has loaded and their locations in memory . It also shows whether each library 's symbol table is loaded or not .
This lists all available signals with a small description and three columns to specify what to do when a signal is received :
The debugger stops the program execution when the program receives this signal .
The debugger passes the signal to the program .
The context menu that is displayed when you click the right mouse button has all its items disabled because the corresponding functions are not implemented yet .
While you are debugging a program , you can find out the value of an expression or variable while the program is paused . It is also sometimes useful to change the value of a variable .
main menu Debug Inspect / Evaluate ... Editor Inspect / Evaluate ...
You can send a custom command to the debugger like this :
The output of the command is displayed in the message window used by the debugger .
Registers whose values have changed since the last stop are in red . It is possible to change the value of any register by clicking in the value column and entering a new value .
The first column displays memory addresses in hexadecimal , the second displays memory contents in hexadecimal and the last column shows memory contents in ASCII .
The first column displays addresses in hexadecimal . In the second column , you can have a label starting at the beginning of the line and ending with a colon or a assembly-language instruction indented by 4 space characters .
The position in the disassembly window will be changed to the program counter value when the program is stopped .
Breakpoints are used to stop the execution of the program at a particular point so that the state of the program can be examined at those locations .
This is the position of the breakpoint in the source file . When the breakpoint is set by the debugger , you can get additional information such as the function containing the breakpoint .
This field is filled with the address of the breakpoint when it is set by the debugger .
This is the breakpoint condition . It is empty if no condition is defined .
When the debugger is not running , this column displays the pass count of the breakpoint , or zero if it is not defined .
When the debugger is running , if the pass count is zero , this column displays the number of times this breakpoint has been triggered . If the pass count is not zero , both numbers are displayed . The pass count is the second number .
This is the state of the breakpoint . It may be
the breakpoint is not set in your program .
the breakpoint is set ( its id number is displayed in parentheses ) .
the breakpoint is set but will be deleted if reached .
All breakpoints are kept across Anjuta sessions even if they correspond to a non-existing locations , for example in a source file of a shared library not loaded yet . In this case their states are set as pending .
main menu Debug Add Breakpoint ... Breakpoint Add Breakpoint ...
Another solution is to use the toggle breakpoint function . If there is no breakpoint on the current line , it will add one . Otherwise , it will remove it .
main menu Debug Toggle Breakpoint Editor Toggle Breakpoint
You can 't change the location of a breakpoint ; create a new breakpoint instead . However , you can change the break condition or the pass count . To edit a breakpoint :
You can remove a breakpoint using the toggle breakpoint function described above . However , if you want to remove more than one breakpoint or the breakpoint is in a different file than the one you are editing , you can use the breakpoint window :
main menu Debug Remove All Breakpoints Breakpoint Remove All Breakpoints
Sometimes you might want to disable a breakpoint temporarily instead of deleting it altogether . To disable or re-enable a breakpoint :
main menu Debug Disable All Breakpoints Breakpoint Disable All Breakpoints
This is the position of the breakpoint . For an existing breakpoint , you cannot change this . You can set a breakpoint at a certain line number , or at the beginning of a function . Use one of the following formats :
The debugger can also skip the breakpoint a certain number of times before breaking . If the pass count is not zero , then the debugger will have to encounter the breakpoint this number of times before breaking .
The pass count has a higher priority than the condition . Only when the pass count has been reached will the debugger evaluate the condition if it is present and break the program 's execution .
The dialog allows you to set global options for building files .
Errors and warnings during the build are displayed and highlighted in the message window . By checking this option , they are higlighted in the editor too .
This plugin is targeted at autotools projects but as they use make it is useful for other kind of projects using make .
Here is a list of the targets used by the plugin . They are implemented in all autotools projects but you need to implement them if you use a custom makefile .
Use to compile an source file . The object file name is found by replacing the source file extension with the corresponding object extension .
Use to build all targets in a directory .
Use to install all targets in a directory .
Use to delete all file built in a directory .
Use to build a distributation package , called only in the project directory .
As make comes with default rules allowing it to compile and link a C program without needing a makefile . You can compile a C program from a single source file without a makefile nor a project .
There are several possibilities to install targets or a project .
Before compiling and building files , an autotools project has to be configured . This step is needed to set global options , to check that all required libraries and programs are installed on your system and to generate appropriate build scripts .
The configuration could fail if some libraries or programs are not installed or do not have the right version . The error message tell you what is missing .
If the project has not been already configured , it will be automatically configured before building any file .
It is a like cleaning the project but it removes even more files . You need to re-configure your project to build it afterward .
You can have several configurations having their own options and build directory , this text box allows to name them . Typically you have already defined a Default configuration , a Debug configuration making programs easier to debug ( keeping intermediate variables and code ordering ) and an Optimized configuration generating faster programs but increasing build time . You can define additional custom configurations .
Select here the build directory , it can be the project directory or a subdirectory . This is particularly useful when switching between different configurations to avoid rebuilding the whole project .
With autotools , you cannot have one configuration using a different directory if you already have one configuration using the project directory . You need to remove it first .
Some autotools project cannot be built outside the project directory . You can still use different configurations but they all have to use the project directory and everything will be recompiled on each change of the configuration .
This text box list all command line arguments used by the configure step . All arguments are separated by spaces and must be quoted if they contains a space . Each configuration fills this text box with default values that you can modify .
Most programming language allow you to compile an individual source file . It reads the file , checks for errors and convert into an intermediate object file . Most errors happens in this step , so it is useful to compile a file after modifying it to check for errors . There are several ways to do it .

It can be useful to delete all files created by the build process . By example if the all dependencies are not taken into account and a modified file does not trigger a recompiling as it should , deleting all files will fix this . There are several way to do this
A target is a file created from source files . Typically , it is a program or a library , but it could also be documentation if the documentation needs processing , for example .
The build command compiles all needed source files , and possibly links them with some other files , like libraries , in order to create the target . If some source files are already compiled and haven 't been modified , they are not be recompiled , in order to save time . There are several ways to trigger a build .

There are different types of target available .
It represents a library shared by several programs which is linked at run time . It is the most common kind of libraries on Linux . It is called dynamic link library on Windows .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name must start with ' lib ' and has the ' .la ' extension .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name does not need the ' lib ' prefix but must have the ' .la ' extension .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name must start with ' lib ' and has the ' .a ' extension .
A target is a file created from source files . Typically , it is a program or a library , but it could also be documentation if the documentation needs processing , for example .

The output of the command is displayed in the message window used by the debugger .
While you are debugging a program , you can find out the value of an expression or variable while the program is paused . It is also sometimes useful to change the value of a variable .
main menu Debug Inspect / Evaluate ... Editor Inspect / Evaluate ...
The debugger can tell you various information about the program while it is running .
This opens a window which will list all shared libraries the program has loaded and their locations in memory . It also shows whether each library 's symbol table is loaded or not .
This lists all available signals with a small description and three columns to specify what to do when a signal is received :
The debugger stops the program execution when the program receives this signal .
The debugger passes the signal to the program .
The context menu that is displayed when you click the right mouse button has all its items disabled because the corresponding functions are not implemented yet .
All local variables are displayed in a tree view with children used to represent structure or array members .
This hides command paths in the process list if checked .
This hides the command line arguments in the process list if checked .
If unchecked , the processes are displayed in a list . If checked , the processes are displayed in a tree .
The debugger can be used on an already running application .
The debugger can be used to debug an application running on another computer connected through a TCP or serial connection .
The debugger and the program can be stopped at any time like this :
A stack frame is the area of the stack associated to each function call . It lists all functions and their arguments in the sequence they were called . Each stack frame is numbered starting from 0 for the current function . You can only view the stack frames while the debugger is running .
Moreover , a program can be composed of several threads . Each thread is executed independently and has its own registers , stack and local variables , but shares all global variables .
The stacks are displayed in a tree view having their corresponding thread as parent and displaying the following information :
This contains a yellow arrow to represent the active stack frame . By default it is frame 0 , the current function . All evaluations and local variables are relative to this active frame . You can change the active stack frame to examine local variables in other functions .
This is a number corresponding to each thread .
The name of the file containing the function corresponding to this frame .
The line number of the function corresponding to this frame .
The name of the function corresponding to this frame .
The address of the function corresponding to this frame .
Like a video editing session , the program can be executed in slow motion with the ability to go forward , pause , stop , and so on . This is essential for tracking program behavior . You cannot go backward yet , though .
Single stepping executes only one statement of the program ( from the place where it has stopped ) and then returns control . If the statement that is executed contains one function , the debugger tries to step inside the functions ( in the sequence in which the functions are executed ) . Once the statement is executed and control is passed back , you can study your program 's state .
Stepping over is similar to stepping except that it does not stop inside any function in the statement being executed .
main menu Debug Step Out Shift F5 Step Out
Stepping out executes the current function until it returns to the calling function .
This command restarts the program and lets it run until a breakpoint is encountered or the program exits .
main menu Debug Run to Cursor F8 Run to
This interrupts the program and returns control to the debugger , allowing you to perform debugging tasks , like inspecting data or adding breakpoints .
Use the program until the critical error occurs .
The top function with frame number 0 is in GLib , so you have to look down in the stack . Typically the error originates from the topmost function that belongs to your program .
Like local variables , all watch expressions are displayed in a tree with children used to represent structure or array members .
The name of the variable or the expression .
The type of the variable or of the expression result .
Watch expressions can be updated automatically as soon as the program is stopped or on user request .
To set a watch expression to update automatically :
To update all watch expressions manually at once :
To add an expression to the watch list :
main menu Debug Add Watch ... Watches Add Watch ...
An expression can be evaluated and then added as a watch like this :
main menu Debug Inspect / Evaluate Editor Inspect / Evaluate
You can remove an expression from the watches list .
All watches can be removed at the same time .
If a watch expression corresponds to a variable , you can change its value .
It is not possible to add or change anything with a project using this backend . But if you create a source file in the project directory , with the right extension , it will be added automatically .
/ * - * - Mode : C ; indent-tabs-mode : t ; c-basic-offset : 4 ; tab-width : 4 - * - * /
Number of space characters corresponding to one tabulation character .
Number of space characters used to indent C code .
/ * vim : set noet ts = 4 sw = 4 : * /
A makefile is probably the most common way to build software on all kinds of platforms . A makefile contains a list or rules describing which commands have to be run in order to generate a target from a list of dependencies . When building a program , the target is an object file and the dependencies are the source files . The target of one rule can be a dependency of another one , allowing several rules to be chained in order to make a final target .
If the project backend is not able to find all the source files , you can try to use the directory backend instead . It does not recognize any targets but should get all source files .
Changing properties , or adding or removing targets and source files are disabled with this backend , as automatically editing the makefile is not implemented . It has to be changed by hand using the text editor . When the makefile is saved , it is automatically reloaded though .
main menu File New Project from Existing Sources Project from Existing Sources New top tool bar
A folder allows you to group several target allowing to set common properties for all of them . It often corresponds to a directory .
Groups names are typically restricted to letters , digits and the underscore , so it 's safer to avoid other characters .
Add , edit or remove folders from a project .
Confirm the removal . This will only remove the folder from the project files without removing any files or directories from your disk .
In order to use a library in C , you need to tell the compiler where the header files are , and tell the linker where to find the needed libraries . The issue is that your program will not compile on another computer if the header and the libraries are elsewhere .
/ usr / include include _ path C preprocessor flags gcc
Linker flags library _ name gcc library _ name lib .a .so
Add a set of libraries to a target .
A package cannot be added directly to your program ; you first need to create a module for it , which is just a group of packages .
project view project context menu Add Library New Library
You will get a list of all the packaged libraries installed on your system . You can check one or more libraries .
Remove a set of libraries from a target .
Confirm the removal . This library will be removed from the target .
Confirm the removal . This package will be removed from the project file .
Whatever the underlying backend , the graphical interface is the same but some functions might be disabled .
You can add files in sub-directories of the project . Most project formats require the files to be under the project directory . Added source files outside the project directory are automatically copied inside to fulfill this requirement .
Add or remove files from a project .
Confirm the removal . The file will only be removed from the project , not from your disk .
Enter a target name and select the type of the target in the drop-down list below . Depending on your project backend , various types of target are possible , see at the bottom .
Target names are typically restricted to letters , digits and the underscore , so it 's safer to avoid other characters .
Add , edit or remove targets from a project .
Confirm the removal . The target and all its properties will be removed from the project file . All its files stay untouched on your hard disk .
Leave the mouse over a project icon for a second and a small pop-up message will appear showing more information about this type of project .
Keep the mouse over the button or typing area for a second to get a small pop-up message with more details about the corresponding setting .
These are the command line arguments used by your program . The drop-down list keeps an history of the last arguments used .
The working directory is the current directory when your program will be run .
You can click on the drop-down section , to display all environment variables that will be accessible by your program . By default , it includes all the current environment variables , they are displayed in light gray .
When a variable has not the same value as in the current environment , it is displayed in black .
This has to be checked to run the program in a terminal allowing you to provide inputs and see its outputs using the standard Unix streams . It is not necessary for programs having a graphical interface .
external ref = ' figures / anjuta _ logo.png ' md5 = ' 82636133d39ac4a688facd76954b8b29 '
In addition some syntax might be too complex for the integrated parser and it might not be able to detect which completion is required
As it is usually quite hard to remember the signature of every method or function used in a project , the editor will automatically display a small tooltip whenever you type ' ( ' after a function name and show you the signature .

Configure and use automatic indentation for a consistent coding style
The big disadvantage of manually configuring indentation is that all developers working on a project must use the same settings or it will result if different styles used in the same files . For a better solution , see the next section .
Unless explicitely changed in the preferences the indentation settings found in the Modeline of a file will be used instead of the configured settings to keep the file consistent .
Modelines are used to help editors to automatically detect the indentation mode which should be used for a particular file . They are especially useful if many developers work on the same project and use different environments .
The symbol browser allows you to get an overview over the symbols used in your project . Symbols refers to variables , functions / methods and classes here and the exact definition depends on the programming language used .
Double click on jumps to the definition of the symbol in the editor .
Once the glade plug-in is running and the file that will hold the code is being viewed , simply double click a widget in the glade inspector . The file being viewed will then be scanned for some marker comments ( / * ANJUTA : Widgets declaration for application.ui - DO NOT REMOVE * / and / * ANJUTA : Widgets initialization for application.ui - DO NOT REMOVE * / ) and , if found , code will be added right after such comments . So , for this feature to work correctly , it is important not to modify such marker comments .
These properties allows you to define common properties for all targets belonging to this folder .

There are different types of target available .
It represents a library shared by several programs which is linked at run time . It is the most common kind of libraries on Linux . It is called dynamic link library on Windows .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name must start with ' lib ' and has the ' .la ' extension .
It represents a library , often named a plugin , linked at run time explicitely by the program itself . It is used to only load the code corresponding to the used features .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name does not need the ' lib ' prefix but must have the ' .la ' extension .
It represents a library linked with the program at compile time . Only the function used are kept inside the generated executable .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name must start with ' lib ' and has the ' .a ' extension .
It represents compiled program by example from C souces files . All children represent the source files compiled to generate the program .
This target allows you to group header files and define where they have to be installed .
It groups man pages needed by the project .
It groups info page needed by the project .
It groups data files which needed by the project like pictures , ui description , settings files ...
It represents program those are scripts . Those scripts are only installed in the specified directory . If scripts are generated additional rules are needed .
A target is a file created from source files . Typically , it is a program or a library , but it could also be documentation if the documentation needs processing , for example .
The build command compiles all needed source files , and possibly links them with some other files , like libraries , in order to create the target . If some source files are already compiled and haven 't been modified , they are not be recompiled , in order to save time . There are several ways to trigger a build .
It can be useful to delete all files created by the build process . For example , if all dependencies are not taken into account and a modified file does not trigger a recompiling as it should , deleting all files will fix this . There are several ways to do this
Most programming languages allow you to compile an individual source file . It reads the file , checks for errors and convert into an intermediate object file . Most errors happens in this step , so it is useful to compile a file after modifying it to check for errors . There are several ways to do it .

project manager context menu Build Compile project manager pane
You can have several configurations having their own options and build directory , this text box allows to name them . Typically you have already defined a Default configuration , a Debug configuration making programs easier to debug ( keeping intermediate variables and code ordering ) and an Optimized configuration generating faster programs but increasing build time . You can define additional custom configurations .
Select here the build directory . It can be the project directory or a subdirectory . This is particularly useful when switching between different configurations to avoid rebuilding the whole project .
With autotools , you cannot have one configuration using a different directory if you already have one configuration using the project directory . You need to remove it first .
Some autotools project cannot be built outside the project directory . You can still use different configurations but they all have to use the project directory and everything will be recompiled on each change of the configuration .
This text box list all command line arguments used by the configure step . All arguments are separated by spaces and must be quoted if they contains a space . Each configuration fills this text box with default values that you can modify .
Before compiling and building files , an autotools project has to be configured . This step is needed to set global options , to check that all required libraries and programs are installed on your system and to generate appropriate build scripts .
The configuration could fail if some libraries or programs are not installed or do not have the right version . The error message tell you what is missing .
If the project has not been already configured , it will be automatically configured before building any file .
It is a like cleaning the project but it removes even more files . You need to re-configure your project to build it afterward .
There are several possibilities to install targets or a project .
This plugin is targeted at autotools projects but as they use make it is useful for other kind of projects using make .
Here is a list of the targets used by the plugin . They are implemented in all autotools projects but you need to implement them if you use a custom makefile .
Use to compile an source file . The object file name is found by replacing the source file extension with the corresponding object extension .
Use to build all targets in a directory .
Use to install all targets in a directory .
Use to delete all file built in a directory .
Use to build a distributation package , called only in the project directory .
As make comes with default rules allowing it to compile and link a C program without needing a makefile . You can compile a C program from a single source file without a makefile nor a project .
The dialog allows you to set global options for building files .
Errors and warnings during the build are displayed and highlighted in the message window . By checking this option , they are highlighted in the editor too .
This is the position of the breakpoint . For an existing breakpoint , you cannot change this . You can set a breakpoint at a certain line number , or at the beginning of a function . Use one of the following formats :
The debugger can also skip the breakpoint a certain number of times before breaking . If the pass count is not zero , then the debugger will have to encounter the breakpoint this number of times before breaking .
The pass count has a higher priority than the condition . Only when the pass count has been reached will the debugger evaluate the condition if it is present and break the program 's execution .
Breakpoints are used to stop the execution of the program at a particular point so that the state of the program can be examined at those locations .
This is the position of the breakpoint in the source file . When the breakpoint is set by the debugger , you can get additional information such as the function containing the breakpoint .
This field is filled with the address of the breakpoint when it is set by the debugger .
This is the breakpoint condition . It is empty if no condition is defined .
When the debugger is not running , this column displays the pass count of the breakpoint , or zero if it is not defined .
When the debugger is running , if the pass count is zero , this column displays the number of times this breakpoint has been triggered . If the pass count is not zero , both numbers are displayed . The pass count is the second number .
This is the state of the breakpoint . It may be
the breakpoint is not set in your program .
the breakpoint is set ( its id number is displayed in parentheses ) .
the breakpoint is set but will be deleted if reached .
All breakpoints are kept across Anjuta sessions even if they correspond to a non-existing locations , for example in a source file of a shared library not loaded yet . In this case their states are set as pending .
main menu Debug Add Breakpoint ... Breakpoint Add Breakpoint ...
Another solution is to use the toggle breakpoint function . If there is no breakpoint on the current line , it will add one . Otherwise , it will remove it .
main menu Debug Toggle Breakpoint Editor Toggle Breakpoint
You can 't change the location of a breakpoint ; create a new breakpoint instead . However , you can change the break condition or the pass count . To edit a breakpoint :
You can remove a breakpoint using the toggle breakpoint function described above . However , if you want to remove more than one breakpoint or the breakpoint is in a different file than the one you are editing , you can use the breakpoint window :
main menu Debug Remove All Breakpoints Breakpoint Remove All Breakpoints
Sometimes you might want to disable a breakpoint temporarily instead of deleting it altogether . To disable or re-enable a breakpoint :
main menu Debug Disable All Breakpoints Breakpoint Disable All Breakpoints
Registers whose values have changed since the last stop are in red . It is possible to change the value of any register by clicking in the value column and entering a new value .
The first column displays memory addresses in hexadecimal , the second displays memory contents in hexadecimal and the last column shows memory contents in ASCII .
The first column displays addresses in hexadecimal . In the second column , you can have a label starting at the beginning of the line and ending with a colon or a assembly-language instruction indented by 4 space characters .
The position in the disassembly window will be changed to the program counter value when the program is stopped .
You can send a custom command to the debugger like this :
The output of the command is displayed in the message window used by the debugger .
While you are debugging a program , you can find out the value of an expression or variable while the program is paused . It is also sometimes useful to change the value of a variable .

The line number of the function corresponding to this frame .
The name of the function corresponding to this frame .
The address of the function corresponding to this frame .
Clicking on a stack frame in the same thread changes only the stack frame , allowing to see other local variables . But doing it in another thread will change both the stack frame and the thread . The register values will be different and the debugger will restart in the selected thread .
Like a video editing session , the program can be executed in slow motion with the ability to go forward , pause , stop , and so on . This is essential for tracking program behavior . You cannot go backward yet , though .

Add a set of libraries to a target .
After creating a new module , you have to wait a few seconds while the project files are reloaded to see the new module in the list .
Packages cannot be added directly to a program but have to be grouped in a module .
You will get a list of all the packaged libraries installed on your system . You can check one or more libraries .
If the library you want does not appear here :
After selecting one library , a module name will be automatically generated but you can change it . You can select an already existing module name to add a new library to it and to all targets already using it .
Remove a set of libraries from a target .
Confirm the removal . This library will be removed from the target .
Confirm the removal . This package will be removed from the project file .

Confirm the removal . The target and all its properties will be removed from the project file . All its files stay untouched on your hard disk .
A project is represented by a tree , the root item corresponds to the project while children represent programs , libraries , directories and source files . Each item can have properties allowing to set more details like project version , compiler flags or installation directories . These item are divided in several categories , depending on the backend not all are available :
There is only one node of this kind . It represents the project itself . It is the place where you can set project wide properties like the project name or the project version .
You can drag and drop targets at the beginning of the project tree view to create a shortcut allowing to access them more easily . By default all program targets are already put here .
Leave the mouse over a project icon for a second and a small pop-up message will appear showing more information about this type of project .

There are different types of target available .
It represents a library shared by several programs which is linked at run time . It is the most common kind of libraries on Linux . It is called dynamic link library on Windows .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name must start with ' lib ' and has the ' .la ' extension .
It represents a library , often named a plugin , linked at run time explicitely by the program itself . It is used to only load the code corresponding to the used features .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name does not need the ' lib ' prefix but must have the ' .la ' extension .
It represents a library linked with the program at compile time . Only the function used are kept inside the generated executable .
It uses the Libtool package . Its name must start with ' lib ' and has the ' .a ' extension .
It represents compiled program by example from C souces files . All children represent the source files compiled to generate the program .
This target allows you to group header files and define where they have to be installed .
It groups man pages needed by the project .
It groups info page needed by the project .
It groups data files which needed by the project like pictures , ui description , settings files ...
It represents program those are scripts . Those scripts are only installed in the specified directory . If scripts are generated additional rules are needed .
A target is a file created from source files . Typically , it is a program or a library , but it could also be documentation if the documentation needs processing , for example .
The build command compiles all needed source files , and possibly links them with some other files , like libraries , in order to create the target . If some source files are already compiled and haven 't been modified , they are not be recompiled , in order to save time . There are several ways to trigger a build .
It can be useful to delete all files created by the build process . For example , if all dependencies are not taken into account and a modified file does not trigger a recompiling as it should , deleting all files will fix this . There are several ways to do this
Most programming languages allow you to compile an individual source file . It reads the file , checks for errors and convert into an intermediate object file . Most errors happens in this step , so it is useful to compile a file after modifying it to check for errors . There are several ways to do it .
file manager context menu Build Compile file manager pane
project manager context menu Build Compile project manager pane
You can have several configurations having their own options and build directory , this text box allows to name them . Typically you have already defined a Default configuration , a Debug configuration making programs easier to debug ( keeping intermediate variables and code ordering ) and an Optimized configuration generating faster programs but increasing build time . You can define additional custom configurations .
Select here the build directory . It can be the project directory or a subdirectory . This is particularly useful when switching between different configurations to avoid rebuilding the whole project .
With autotools , you cannot have one configuration using a different directory if you already have one configuration using the project directory . You need to remove it first .
Some autotools project cannot be built outside the project directory . You can still use different configurations but they all have to use the project directory and everything will be recompiled on each change of the configuration .
This text box list all command line arguments used by the configure step . All arguments are separated by spaces and must be quoted if they contains a space . Each configuration fills this text box with default values that you can modify .
Before compiling and building files , an autotools project has to be configured . This step is needed to set global options , to check that all required libraries and programs are installed on your system and to generate appropriate build scripts .
The configuration could fail if some libraries or programs are not installed or do not have the right version . The error message tell you what is missing .
If the project has not been already configured , it will be automatically configured before building any file .
It is a like cleaning the project but it removes even more files . You need to re-configure your project to build it afterward .
There are several possibilities to install targets or a project .
This plugin is targeted at autotools projects but as they use make it is useful for other kind of projects using make .
Here is a list of the targets used by the plugin . They are implemented in all autotools projects but you need to implement them if you use a custom makefile .
Use to compile an source file . The object file name is found by replacing the source file extension with the corresponding object extension .
Use to build all targets in a directory .
Use to install all targets in a directory .
Use to delete all file built in a directory .
Use to build a distributation package , called only in the project directory .
As make comes with default rules allowing it to compile and link a C program without needing a makefile . You can compile a C program from a single source file without a makefile nor a project .
The dialog allows you to set global options for building files .
Errors and warnings during the build are displayed and highlighted in the message window . By checking this option , they are highlighted in the editor too .
This is the position of the breakpoint . For an existing breakpoint , you cannot change this . You can set a breakpoint at a certain line number , or at the beginning of a function . Use one of the following formats :
The debugger can also skip the breakpoint a certain number of times before breaking . If the pass count is not zero , then the debugger will have to encounter the breakpoint this number of times before breaking .
The pass count has a higher priority than the condition . Only when the pass count has been reached will the debugger evaluate the condition if it is present and break the program 's execution .
Breakpoints are used to stop the execution of the program at a particular point so that the state of the program can be examined at those locations .
This is the position of the breakpoint in the source file . When the breakpoint is set by the debugger , you can get additional information such as the function containing the breakpoint .
This field is filled with the address of the breakpoint when it is set by the debugger .
This is the breakpoint condition . It is empty if no condition is defined .
When the debugger is not running , this column displays the pass count of the breakpoint , or zero if it is not defined .
When the debugger is running , if the pass count is zero , this column displays the number of times this breakpoint has been triggered . If the pass count is not zero , both numbers are displayed . The pass count is the second number .
This is the state of the breakpoint . It may be
the breakpoint is not set in your program .
the breakpoint is set ( its id number is displayed in parentheses ) .
the breakpoint is set but will be deleted if reached .
All breakpoints are kept across Anjuta sessions even if they correspond to a non-existing locations , for example in a source file of a shared library not loaded yet . In this case their states are set as pending .
main menu Debug Add Breakpoint ... Breakpoint Add Breakpoint ...
Another solution is to use the toggle breakpoint function . If there is no breakpoint on the current line , it will add one . Otherwise , it will remove it .
main menu Debug Toggle Breakpoint Editor Toggle Breakpoint
You can 't change the location of a breakpoint ; create a new breakpoint instead . However , you can change the break condition or the pass count . To edit a breakpoint :
You can remove a breakpoint using the toggle breakpoint function described above . However , if you want to remove more than one breakpoint or the breakpoint is in a different file than the one you are editing , you can use the breakpoint window :
main menu Debug Remove All Breakpoints Breakpoint Remove All Breakpoints
Sometimes you might want to disable a breakpoint temporarily instead of deleting it altogether . To disable or re-enable a breakpoint :
main menu Debug Disable All Breakpoints Breakpoint Disable All Breakpoints
Registers whose values have changed since the last stop are in red . It is possible to change the value of any register by clicking in the value column and entering a new value .
The first column displays memory addresses in hexadecimal , the second displays memory contents in hexadecimal and the last column shows memory contents in ASCII .
The first column displays addresses in hexadecimal . In the second column , you can have a label starting at the beginning of the line and ending with a colon or a assembly-language instruction indented by 4 space characters .
The position in the disassembly window will be changed to the program counter value when the program is stopped .
You can send a custom command to the debugger like this :
The output of the command is displayed in the message window used by the debugger .
While you are debugging a program , you can find out the value of an expression or variable while the program is paused . It is also sometimes useful to change the value of a variable .
main menu Debug Inspect / Evaluate ... Editor Inspect / Evaluate ...
The debugger can tell you various information about the program while it is running .
This opens a window which will list all shared libraries the program has loaded and their locations in memory . It also shows whether each library 's symbol table is loaded or not .
This lists all available signals with a small description and three columns to specify what to do when a signal is received :
The debugger stops the program execution when the program receives this signal .
The debugger passes the signal to the program .
The context menu that is displayed when you click the right mouse button has all its items disabled because the corresponding functions are not implemented yet .
All local variables are displayed in a tree view with children used to represent structure or array members .
This hides command paths in the process list if checked .
This hides the command line arguments in the process list if checked .
If unchecked , the processes are displayed in a list . If checked , the processes are displayed in a tree .
The debugger can be used on an already running application .
The debugger can be used to debug an application running on another computer connected through a TCP or serial connection .
The debugger and the program can be stopped at any time like this :
A stack frame is the area of the stack associated to each function call . It lists all functions and their arguments in the sequence they were called . Each stack frame is numbered starting from 0 for the current function . You can only view the stack frames while the debugger is running .
Moreover , a program can be composed of several threads . Each thread is executed independently and has its own registers , stack and local variables , but shares all global variables .
The stacks are displayed in a tree view having their corresponding thread as parent and displaying the following information :
This contains a yellow arrow to represent the active stack frame . By default it is frame 0 , the current function . All evaluations and local variables are relative to this active frame . You can change the active stack frame to examine local variables in other functions .
This is a number corresponding to each thread .
The name of the file containing the function corresponding to this frame .
The line number of the function corresponding to this frame .
The name of the function corresponding to this frame .
The address of the function corresponding to this frame .
Clicking on a stack frame in the same thread changes only the stack frame , allowing to see other local variables . But doing it in another thread will change both the stack frame and the thread . The register values will be different and the debugger will restart in the selected thread .
Like a video editing session , the program can be executed in slow motion with the ability to go forward , pause , stop , and so on . This is essential for tracking program behavior . You cannot go backward yet , though .
Single stepping executes only one statement of the program ( from the place where it has stopped ) and then returns control . If the statement that is executed contains one function , the debugger tries to step inside the functions ( in the sequence in which the functions are executed ) . Once the statement is executed and control is passed back , you can study your program 's state .
Stepping over is similar to stepping except that it does not stop inside any function in the statement being executed .
main menu Debug Step Out Shift F5 Step Out
Stepping out executes the current function until it returns to the calling function .
This command restarts the program and lets it run until a breakpoint is encountered or the program exits .
main menu Debug Run to Cursor F8 Run to
This interrupts the program and returns control to the debugger , allowing you to perform debugging tasks , like inspecting data or adding breakpoints .
Use the program until the critical error occurs .
The top function with frame number 0 is in GLib , so you have to look down in the stack . Typically the error originates from the topmost function that belongs to your program .
Like local variables , all watch expressions are displayed in a tree with children used to represent structure or array members .
The name of the variable or the expression .
The type of the variable or of the expression result .
Watch expressions can be updated automatically as soon as the program is stopped or on user request .
To set a watch expression to update automatically :
To update all watch expressions manually at once :
To add an expression to the watch list :
main menu Debug Add Watch ... Watches Add Watch ...
An expression can be evaluated and then added as a watch like this :
main menu Debug Inspect / Evaluate Editor Inspect / Evaluate
You can remove an expression from the watches list .
All watches can be removed at the same time .
If a watch expression corresponds to a variable , you can change its value .
It is not possible to add or change anything with a project using this backend . But if you create a source file in the project directory , with the right extension , it will be added automatically .
/ * - * - Mode : C ; indent-tabs-mode : t ; c-basic-offset : 4 ; tab-width : 4 - * - * /
Number of space characters corresponding to one tabulation character .
Number of space characters used to indent C code .
/ * vim : set noet ts = 4 sw = 4 : * /
A makefile is probably the most common way to build software on all kinds of platforms . A makefile contains a list or rules describing which commands have to be run in order to generate a target from a list of dependencies . When building a program , the target is an object file and the dependencies are the source files . The target of one rule can be a dependency of another one , allowing several rules to be chained in order to make a final target .
If the project backend is not able to find all the source files , you can try to use the directory backend instead . It does not recognize any targets but should get all source files .
Changing properties , or adding or removing targets and source files are disabled with this backend , as automatically editing the makefile is not implemented . It has to be changed by hand using the text editor . When the makefile is saved , it is automatically reloaded though .
main menu File New Project from Existing Sources Project from Existing Sources New top tool bar
A folder allows you to group several target allowing to set common properties for all of them . It often corresponds to a directory .
Groups names are typically restricted to letters , digits and the underscore , so it 's safer to avoid other characters .
Add , edit or remove folders from a project .
Confirm the removal . This will only remove the folder from the project files without removing any files or directories from your disk .
In order to use a library in C , you need to tell the compiler where the header files are , and tell the linker where to find the needed libraries . The issue is that your program will not compile on another computer if the header and the libraries are elsewhere .
/ usr / include include _ path C preprocessor flags gcc
Linker flags library _ name gcc library _ name lib .a .so
Add a set of libraries to a target .
After creating a new module , you have to wait a few seconds while the project files are reloaded to see the new module in the list .
Packages cannot be added directly to a program but have to be grouped in a module .
You will get a list of all the packaged libraries installed on your system . You can check one or more libraries .
If the library you want does not appear here :
After selecting one library , a module name will be automatically generated but you can change it . You can select an already existing module name to add a new library to it and to all targets already using it .
Remove a set of libraries from a target .
Confirm the removal . This library will be removed from the target .
Confirm the removal . This package will be removed from the project file .
Whatever the underlying backend , the graphical interface is the same but some functions might be disabled .
You can add files in sub-directories of the project . Most project formats require the files to be under the project directory . Added source files outside the project directory are automatically copied inside to fulfill this requirement .
Add or remove files from a project .
Confirm the removal . The file will only be removed from the project , not from your disk .
A target groups files together and defines their use . It is used to represent a program , with all its source files as its children or only group data files those should be installed at the same place .
Enter a target name and select the type of the target in the drop-down list below . Depending on your project backend , various types of target are possible , see at the bottom .
Target names are typically restricted to letters , digits and the underscore , so it 's safer to avoid other characters .
Add , edit or remove targets from a project .
Confirm the removal . The target and all its properties will be removed from the project file . All its files stay untouched on your hard disk .
A project is represented by a tree , the root item corresponds to the project while children represent programs , libraries , directories and source files . Each item can have properties allowing to set more details like project version , compiler flags or installation directories . These item are divided in several categories , depending on the backend not all are available :
There is only one node of this kind . It represents the project itself . It is the place where you can set project wide properties like the project name or the project version .
You can drag and drop targets at the beginning of the project tree view to create a shortcut allowing to access them more easily . By default all program targets are already put here .
Leave the mouse over a project icon for a second and a small pop-up message will appear showing more information about this type of project .
Keep the mouse over the button or typing area for a second to get a small pop-up message with more details about the corresponding setting .
These are the command line arguments used by your program . The drop-down list keeps an history of the last arguments used .
The working directory is the current directory when your program will be run .
You can click on the drop-down section , to display all environment variables that will be accessible by your program . By default , it includes all the current environment variables , they are displayed in light gray .
When a variable has not the same value as in the current environment , it is displayed in black .
This has to be checked to run the program in a terminal allowing you to provide inputs and see its outputs using the standard Unix streams . It is not necessary for programs having a graphical interface .

This displays the email that is selected in the message index . Message headers are displayed above the main text of the message , unless they have been disabled . The text of the message is shown below the headers .
When the message window first opens , you will see the several main sections :
These will each be covered in depth below :
This contains all of the available commands for acting on the message , from selecting the headers to display to changing the character set of the message . Some of the menu items are not always available , depending on what state the message is currently in .
The file menu contains commands for manipulating the message as a whole .
The Edit menu contains commands which are used to modify the body of the message .
The Show menu is used to control which headers are displayed in the composer window for editing .
The Language menu allows you to set the language to use for composing and checking the spelling of the message .
Format = Flowed embarrassing line wrap
The following options determine the protocol used for signing and / or encrypting the message . You should choose the appropriate protocol which all recipients can use .
The toolbar contains buttons for the most commonly used functions when sending messages , including Send , Attach File ... , and Save . As with the menu bar , some buttons are disabled if the message is not correctly setup to be sent .
Open a dialog to attach a file to the current message .
Postpone the message to the Draftbox for later revision and sending .
Close the composition window without saving or sending the message within .
Again , not a very widely used header , this can be used to embed general information about the content of the message in the email , to allow for easier searching or filtering at a later date .
The buttons on the left control the actions to take for each incorrect word . The buttons include :
Change the incorrect word with the currently selected suggested word or the user 's edited word .
Change all occurances of the current incorrect word with the currently selected suggestion .
Ignore the current incorrect word and continue to the next one .
Ignore all occurrances of the current word , and continue to the next incorrect word .
Add the current incorrect word to your personal dictionary . This will cause it to be considered correct for all future spell checks .
This page lets you specify how you get POP3 mail , send mail , etc .
The server you have the POP mailbox on .
The port that will be used to connect to the server . The port number is usually 110 but you may change it if you for example use some kind of connection tunneling ,
The user name on the SMTP server . If the remote SMTP server requires authentication , enter your user name here . Note that the exact format depends on the MTA in use . For example , some systems expect a user name , others may require an email address .
Corresponding pass phrase . If the remote SMTP server requires authentication , enter your pass phrase here . Some systems refer to the pass phrase as a password . Limitations on the length of the pass phrase depend on the SMTP server .
Checking IMAP mailboxes can take some time ; these options give you extra control over how long the mailbox check will take .
Don 't include HTML parts as text when replying or forwarding mail
Forward a mail as attachment instead of quoting it
A space-separated list of the headers to display in the message window .
The Normal mode is probably good enough for most people ; it should produce the correct suggestion in the majority of cases .
This provides the ability to ignore words shorter than a certain length . It may be useful to automatically skip short acronyms that are normally flagged as incorrect .
This enables you to change the properties of the selected address book .
It is possible to modify both the name and location for any address book . Also , you can change whether the contents of the address book will be used when attempting to auto-complete an address when sending a message .
If you prefer to have the whole tree available from startup , choose a depth as great as that of your folder tree . Intermediate settings may also be used .
Expunge deleted messages on close
The basic IMAP folder configuration tab is probably the only part you need to fill in .
Server is the host name or IP number of the IMAP server .
User name is the name used for authorization on the IMAP server .
Some servers allow anonymous access to bulletin boards or mailing list archives . Check this box if you want to use this mode - you will not be asked for password .
Password is the password used for authorization on the IMAP server .
You can choose among several address book types .
The following programs are compatible with the mutt mail reader and / should / be with balsa . Submit links to more programs .
The three fields should be separated by tabs . The third field is currently not used by balsa , but might be in the future . It is also kept to ensure compatibility with mutt .
All characters are allowed , except the tab ( \ \ t ) , since that is the field separator .
Your script / program should write it 's output to stdout and not to stderr !
Adding addresses is also possible . Your script should receive 3 arguments . The first is an email address , the second a full name and the third is an alias ( currently not used and replaced by ' TODO ' ) .
Note that mutt does not have support for adding addresses and there is thus no compatibility in this case .
This dialog window lets you specify how you present yourself to the rest of the world through your email . The first page has your general information :
The default value for the blind-carbon-copy field when using this identity . Useful if you want to always send a copy of outgoing mail to another account .
The prefix for the subject line when replying to a message .
The prefix for the subject line when forwarding a message .
The file containing the signature to append to all your messages . This can be generated in one of three ways :
From a regular file . List the path to any regular file , and the text from that file will be appended to your messages .
Append the signature to the end of all outgoing mail .
Add the signature when forwarding an existing mail .
Add the signature when replying to a existing message .
Before sending a message , check if valid keys are present for all recipients and show a dialog in this case .
AND : all condition tests must be true to make the match .
OR : one condition test must be true to make the match .
What 's that window that flashed on the screen ?
The address book doesn 't import my addresses .
An acronym for " Lightweight Directory Access Protocol " . It is a widely-accepted standard for accessing contact information over a network . This enables organizations to store address information in a central database , but have many people able to access it .

Your music and video sources are shown on the left in Banshee . The sources give you quick access to your Play Queue , Music , Videos , Amazon , Last.fm , Podcasts and more .
The menu choices will change depending on the source you have chosen . For example , to use the menu to import a Podcast , you will need to choose the Podcast source . The menu option for importing a Podcast is not available when viewing the video or music library .
When you select a music or video source from Sources , Banshee will display your content in the Library browser . Depending on the source you choose , Banshee can display your music or video library , Podcast subscriptions or even the Amazon Music Store to allow you to buy music .
Helpful when using Banshee in full screen mode , the Now Playing mode hides the library to give you a larger view of the music or video you 're watching . When listening to music , the Now Playing view will show you the artist name , album and cover art if available . If you are watching a video , Banshee will display the video .
The Library view in Banshee will change depending on the Source you have chosen . The Music Library will display cover art , artists in your library , and list of songs . The Podcast Library will display your Podcast subscriptions , podcasts that are downloaded or not downloaded , and all , new or old podcasts . Please see each Source 's help page for detailed information on managing a source .
Sync your media to a portable media player or smartphone .
Banshee supports syncing your music to portable media players and smartphones . You can add specific music tracks , albums or playlist or allow Banshee to keep your music player in sync with your entire library . After your player is connected to your computer you can also play back the songs on your portable player in Banshee . When syncing music in a lossless format , such as FLAC , Banshee will automatically transcode your music for you to a lossy format such as Ogg Vorbis or MP3 , if you have the correct codecs installed .
Banshee supports almost all modern portable music players and smartphones with the notable exception of the Apple iPhone , iPad and iPod Touch .
When you plug your device in , Banshee will display it in the left menu . Pressing the device icon will take you to your device home page in Banshee displaying your sync preferences .
You can choose to manage the media on your portable music by having Banshee automatically sync it or manage your music and media manually .
Choose your device from the Banshee menu and then choose how you want to sync your media , including :
From the dropdown menu next to each of the media , choose from :
If you choose to sync your entire library automatically with your portable media player make sure your portable media player has enough storage space . If your library is larger than the space on your portable media player , Banshee will sync media until your player is full and then stop .
If you have created playlists or smart playlists in your music library , they will also be displayed as a sync option for Music . This can be helpful when creating smart playlists , as smart playlists will automatically update as new content is added based on the playlist rules , and Banshee will sync the new playlist to your device every time you plug it in .
Banshee will display the total hard drive space of your portable music player in a graph in the bottom center of Banshee . The graph will show you how much space is taken by audio files , video , other and free space . Directly below that Banshee will show you how many total items are stored on your portable music player , how many hours or days of listening that is equal to , and total space used .
You can drag and drop media to your portable music player form Banshee . Select the file or files you want to copy to your portable media player and then press and hold your right mouse button and drag the file ( s ) to your portable media player icon in Banshee . This will copy the files to your device .
If your music library is encoded in a format that your portable media player does not support , such as OGG or FLAC , and you have the necessary codecs installed , Banshee can automatically transcode these files to MP3 when transferring to your portable media player . Check with your Linux distribution for the necessary codecs as it is outside the scope of this help and varies by distribution .
You can play music stored on your portable music player directly in Banshee . Choose your player in the Banshee menu on the left and your portable music player 's library will be displayed . You can then play music in Banshee just as you would music in your own library .
Deleting files from your portable music player will permanently remove the files and you will not be able to recover them .
As your library grows , you may want to sort your library view to play search or view certain songs , artists , or albums .
Banshee features a powerful search language . You can search your library quickly and easily with basic search terms or perform detailed searches with Banshee 's advanced search terminology .

Burn an existing disc image to a CD or DVD .
Disc images are archive files which contain all the data that is on a CD or DVD . Only one disc image can be on a CD at a time , but each archive can contain as little or as much data as you want , as long as it fits on the disc .
To burn a disc image to a CD or DVD , follow these steps :
If you are using a re-writable disc , which already contains data , you will be asked if you want to blank it or insert a different disc .
Disc copy Project New Project Copy Disc ...
Choose whether you want to make a copy to another disc or create an image for later use .
If you are copying the disc and have only one disc drive , you will be asked to replace the disc you are copying with a writable one after the contents are copied temporarily to your hard disk .
A data project is used for writing data ( for example , files , photos or music ) to a disc , without changing those files in any way . This can be useful for transferring files between computers .
If you are using a rewritable disc , which already contains data , you will be asked if you want to blank it or insert a different disc .
If you are using a rewritable disc and the data is not burned correctly onto it , you may need to do a full ( non-fast ) blank of the disc before trying again .
You can add a title for the CD in the text entry field below the project area .
Select the blank CD in the drop down list .
I cannot write to a DVD-R or a DVD-RW .
Some types of DVD-Rs and DVD-RWs are not compatible with all burners . Check the following to find out if those can be used with your burner .
Check if your DVD drive accepts DVD + or DVD- discs ; if it is labelled with " multi " , that usually indicates that it accepts both . Check your disc to see if it is the same as the DVD drive .
Check if your disc is dual layer or single layer : some DVD drives can not write to a dual layer disc .
If you are trying to use a DVD-R , check if it has already been written to before . If you are using a DVD-RW , try blanking it before you attempt to write to it .
My MP3s will not play in a DVD or CD player .
If your CD is not playing in your CD player or stereo , it is probably because the music was not correctly written to the disc or because you used a data project to write the music to the CD instead of an audio project .
Many new CD and DVD players will play music CDs which were created using a data project , but most older players will not .
Older CD players might not be able to play CD-RWs .
If you are using a CD-RW , blank the CD .

Cheese uses your webcam to take photos and videos , applies fancy special effects and lets you share the fun with others .
The main screen of Cheese supports two different layouts at the moment . The default looks like the screenshot below , it has the preview image centered and the thumbnail slideshow below .
Especially for Cheese-users with small displays , like the ones in netbooks , we have designed another view . It is more horizontally aligned , in order to fit better on small widescreen displays . The wide-view is shown in the screenshot below .
Cheese uses the photo mode by defaults , but you can change this to use the video or burst mode if desired .
Cheese Video Start Recording Spacebar Stop Recording Spacebar
To take a photo with Cheese , be sure to be in the Photo mode “ ” .
If your video appears to be jerky or has a low frame rate ( only updating the picture every few seconds ) , it does not mean that the recording has a similar frame rate . In many cases , the recorded file will have a better frame rate .
The preferences dialog allows you to set up some webcam specific parameters and parameters specific to the burst mode . If you have more than one webcam or video device attached to your system , the preferences dialog allows you to choose which one you would like to use for Cheese and what resolution the image should have . Use the sliders to play around with the brightness , contrast , saturation and hue values to find the best for your webcam .
The parameters for the burst mode can be set in the preferences dialog as well . You only have to adjust the values for the number of photos you wish to take and the delay in seconds between each picture taken .
Attention : Be careful while using GConf to change your settings ! If you are not completely sure about what you are doing , you should ask someone who knows !
This will move the image to the " trash " , as well as remove from your photo stream . This will not remove the photo from your computer . To remove it from your system , you will need to empty your trash .
This will open the default mail client ( for example , Evolution ) and a new email message will be created with the photo you selected as an attachment .
Depending on the version of Cheese that you are currently using , F-Spot may prompt you to import the entire photo stream .

Save a photo or video in a different folder .
Alternatively , open the folder where you want to keep the image using the file manager , then drag it from the photo stream into that folder .
Use your webcam to take photos instead of videos .
Webcams can be used to take still photos as well as videos . To take a photo :
There will be a short countdown , followed by a flash , and the photo will appear in the photo stream .
Photos and videos will automatically appear in the photo stream .
After you take a photo or record a video , it will appear in the photo stream at the bottom of the window .
If you want to see a bigger version of a photo , or to play a video , double-click it . This will open it in the default photo viewer or video player .

Adjust the saturation , contrast , brightness and hue to make photos and videos look better .
If your photos or videos are too dark or the colors seem to be wrong , try adjusting their saturation , contrast , brightness and hue :
Move the sliders to find the best settings for your webcam .
Increasing the brightness will make the photos and videos lighter . However , if you are in a dark room , increasing the brightness might make the image look more noisy .
Setting a higher contrast will increase the difference between darker and lighter colors . If the image looks washed out , try increasing the contrast .
Changing the hue of the image will add a tint to it . If image seems to be the wrong color ( for example , too yellow ) , try changing the hue .
Reducing the saturation makes the image less colorful . If colors seem too harsh , reduce the saturation .
The resolution of a video or photo determines how much detail you can see in it , changing it will affect the file size .
Higher resolution generally means better quality images , but photos and videos with higher resolution take up more space on your hard disk . High resolution videos , in particular , take up a lot of space .
If you want your images to take up less disk space , reduce the resolution of your webcam . If you want better quality images , increase the resolution . To change the webcam resolution :
Choose a different resolution from the drop-down list . Some webcams only support one resolution , so you may not have a choice .
Use your webcam to record short movies for sharing with friends .

The default target gamma value for the display . Common values are 1.8 , 2.2 and 2.4 .
The default target whitepoint in Kelvin for display calibration , with 0 meaning display native . Common values are 6500 for D65 and 5000 for D50 .
This is the delay between setting the sample color and asking the measuring instrument to take a sample . It is required because both the graphics driver and the display itself introduce latency .
The URI of the web service that allows the calibration tools to upload a specific profile to the Internet .
This editing space was designed as SMPTE-240M and encompasses most of the possible colors available on a CMYK color printer . This is a popular choice for editing photographs and for use in printing , as all the SWOP colors can be reproduced .
This legacy profile was originally created by Adobe for use with Photoshop and Illustrator . As it is based on the original Apple 13 " RGB monitor and is similar to sRGB , it should not be used as a display profile or for new images .
This editing space can display more saturated colors than Adobe RGB and is suitable for images with highly saturated colors often used in advertisements . It is very similar to DonRGB4 , but can show super-saturated red colors sometimes present in Fujichrome Velvia .
This editing space can display more saturated colors than Adobe RGB . It is less prone to quantisation errors compared to ProPhoto RGB , although more shadow detail is preserved . In most instances ProPhoto RGB is probably a better choice .
This test profile is used to make all colors on the screen slightly more blue by altering the video card lookup table . This allows the user to check the calibration is being applied correctly .
This is an RGB editing space for use with Adobe Photoshop 5.0 and later . It was designed as an output-centric compromise between ColorMatch RGB and Adobe RGB and used to be preferred by some photograph printing services .
This theoretical profile is designed for use in color experiments . You probably don 't want to use this profile as a editing space or a display profile .
This profile was designed by Radius for the PressView monitor . Only use this profile as a display profile or as a editing space as the profile is not significantly different to sRGB . You should only need to use this profile if viewing images created on a PressView monitor .
This named color profile contains all the Crayola crayon colors in popular use . It is a test profile designed for testing embedding named colors into documents .
This editing space can display more saturated colors than Adobe RGB and is suitable for images with highly saturated colors often used in advertisements .
This profile is recommended by the ECI ( European Color Initiative ) as a editing space for professional image editing and aims to cover all colors that can be printed on printing presses . This is sometimes used as a color data exchange format between publishers and printing houses .
This profile was designed for storing archives of scanned transparency film . It is suitable for storing images from color negatives , although nowadays ProPhoto RGB is a more popular profile for archival .
This profile is used for positive plate making , printing on paper types 1 and 2 ( coated or matte ) , sheetfed offset . This profile set should no longer be used for production , use FOGRA39L instead .
This profile is used for positive plate making , printing on paper type 3 ( LWC ) , webfed offset . This profile should no longer be used for production , use FOGRA45 instead .
This profile is used for positive plate making , printing on paper type 4 ( uncoated white ) , sheetfed offset . This profile should no longer be used for production , use FOGRA47 instead .
This profile is used for positive plate making , printing on paper type 5 ( uncoated yellowish ) , sheetfed offset .
This profile is used for printing on paper types 1 and 2 ( coated or matte ) , sheetfed offset . This profile is not significantly different from U.S. GRACoL 2006 ( TR 006 ) .
This profile is used for printing on U.S. grade 1 and 2 coated paper , sheetfed offset and gravure . It is the U.S. equivalent of FOGRA39 .
This profile defines the range of colors used with the NTSC video standard . It is an obsolete standard that has been replaced by SMTE-C . You should only use this profile to decode archived video .
This profile defines the range of colors used with the PAL and SECAM video standards and is very similar to sRGB . You should only use this profile to encode or decode video .
Originally designed by Eastman Kodak and called ROMM RGB , this profile can display a very large range of colors and is used by many photographers for rendering , editing and archiving RAW images . Unless you are working with 16 bits per channel precision , you may see color banding when editing images .
ITU-R recommendation BT.709 is a high-definition television standard that was first approved in 1990 . The Rec . 709 profile uses the same range of colors as sRGB although the luminance curve is different .
This is the current standard used by North America and Japan for studio recording . You should only use this profile to encode or decode video .
This general purpose profile was designed by Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft and lives on as the default profile on the Internet for untagged RGB colors and used in HDTV . Most uncalibrated displays are able to display most of the colors available in sRGB , although this profile is sometimes a poor choice for printing .
This test profile swaps the red and green channels and is useful as a visual check that profiles are being applied correctly . If this profile is applied twice , the image looks unchanged .
This profile is used for printing on U.S. grade 3 coated paper , sheetfed offset and gravure . It is used for high quality magazine printing with white paper .
This profile is used for printing on U.S. grade 5 coated paper , sheetfed offset and gravure . It is use for standard magazine printing with yellowish paper .
This editing space was designed by Adobe Systems to capture many more colors than Adobe RGB . This profile is used to print to devices such as film recorders and can define many colors that cannot be displayed on a computer screen . Unless you are working with 16 bits per channel precision , you may see color banding when editing images .
This named color profile contains all the colors defined by X11 , assuming the source colors were supposed to be sRGB .

This documentation is for version 3.00 of Ekiga .
Ekiga is an application for voice over IP , IP telephony , and video conferencing , with support for many audio and video codecs .

The Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP ) is a protocol developed by the IETF MMUSIC Working Group and proposed standard for initiating , modifying , and terminating an interactive user session that involves multimedia elements such as video , voice , instant messaging , online games , and virtual reality . In November 2000 , SIP was accepted as a 3GPP signaling protocol and permanent element of the IMS architecture . It is one of the leading signalling protocols for Voice over IP .
H.323 was originally created to provide a mechanism for transporting multimedia applications over LANs but it has rapidly evolved to address the growing needs of VoIP networks . One strength of H.323 was the relatively early availability of a set of standards , not only defining the basic call model , but in addition the supplementary services , needed to address business communication expectations . H.323 was the first VoIP standard to adopt the IETF standard RTP to transport audio and video over IP networks . H.323 is based on the ISDN Q.931 protocol and is suited for interworking scenarios between IP and ISDN , respectively between IP and QSIG . A call model , similar to the ISDN call model , eases the introduction of IP Telephony into existing networks of ISDN based PBX systems .
All settings can be changed via the preferences window at anytime .
This page welcomes you to the Configuration Assistant . There is nothing to change or edit here . Press the ' Forward ' button towards the bottom of the window to start the configuration .

It is also possible to call contacts using the address book , the call history or the roster . You can add contacts you call frequently to your roster , and watch their presence information in order to know when they are available . Please refer to the appropriate section of the manual for full explanations .
With the default setup , you can simply use sip : 3210444555 and select sip.diamondcard.us in the list to call the real phone number + 3210444555 , 32 is the country code , 10444555 is the number to call .
You can also dial real phone numbers from the address book . If the phone number of the contact you want to call is stored in the address book , simply select Action -gt ; Call [ Ekiga Call Out ] when the contact is highlighted . It will dial the phone number of the contact using the Ekiga Call Out account .
From real phone to computer ( Phone-To-PC )
You can actually use any H.323 or SIP ITSP provider , including your own PBX at work . However we recommend using the integrated provider .
To add a contact to the roster , select Chat-gt ; Add Contact , and fill in the required fields . If the service managing the URI you entered for the contact is able to publish presence status , Ekiga will automatically display it .
If you do not know the VoIP URI of a contact , you might try searching for him using the Ekiga.net online directory . To do so , select Chat -gt ; Address Book , and start searching using the ' Search Filter ' feature .
You can organise your contacts in groups in the roster .
The LDAP Address Book supports a range of settings to allow it to work with any LDAPv3 directory . It allows you to choose the attribute to use for displaying a contact 's name in the address book as well as a list of attributes for callng info . E.g. , if the directory uses the LDAP inetOrgPerson schema you can configure the Address Book to retrieve the homePhone , mobile , and pager attributes make those values available for calling or messaging . You can also customize a Filter Template for the default LDAP search filter , and override the default filter at any time if you need to perform a more specialized search . The browser also supports all security options for LDAP including ldaps : / / ( LDAP over SSL ) , StartTLS , and SASL authentication .
To refresh the list of users for a specific address book , simply click the Find button . It will search for all users in that address book . You can contact people by double clicking on their highlighted field . You can also message them by right-clicking or by choosing the appropriate action in the Action menu of the window .
Local address books provided by Novell Evolution allow you to add new contacts , or to edit existing contacts . Each different address book allows a different set of features depending on what makes sense for the address book in question . To discover what features are possible , simply select the address book and consult the Action menu .
To add a contact to one of your local address books , simply select the address book you wish to add the contact to and select Action -gt ; New Contact . The option of adding a New Contact will appear and you may now enter his name and VoIP URI as well as other settings . After complete select ' OK ' and now your contact has been added . You can only add contacts to local address books . The contact parameters can be changed at any time by selecting Action -gt ; Properties when the contact is highlighted . He can also be deleted by selecting Action -gt ; Remove .
You can also add a contact from the white pages ( or any other local or remote address book ) to the roster by selecting Action -gt ; Add to local roster when the contact is highlighted .

Choosing a higher framerate and a lower quality will have the same result in terms of video bandwidth as choosing a higher quality with a lower framerate . The choice depends on if you prefer using your bandwidth to transmit more lower quality images or fewer high quality images .
When you reorder the codecs , you are reordering the local capabilities table , ie the codecs you will use for sending . You will always transmit audio and video using the first codec in the corresponding table that is in common with the remote user . The remote user will transmit audio and video using the first codec in his table that is common with you .
You can force the use of a specific codec by disabling all other codecs , but it will result in failed calls if the remote user doesn 't support that specific codec . The best approach is to put your preferred codecs at the top of the list so that you always transmit with them if the remote user allows it and to disable the codecs that you don 't want to use for transmission and reception .
You can adjust the delay to wait before playing the sound buffers that you have received using the jitter buffer adjustment . If there is too much packet loss , the delay required to have received all packets could be so important that it will exceed the jitter buffer . In such a case , the sound you are receiving will be of bad quality . A solution to that problem would be to increase the maximum limit of the jitter buffer to a few seconds , resulting in a big delay but in an improved voice quality . Notice that the jitter buffer will readapt itself to the lowest delay allowing for optimum transmission , and that a bad voice quality in reception is not due to a too low jitter buffer value , but to bad internet connection quality .
The outbound proxy is the SIP proxy that will relay your calls . The behavior of a SIP proxy is similar to the behavior of an HTTP proxy , i.e. some entity that issues the requests on your behalf and proxies the streams .
The URI to which SIP incoming calls should be forwarded if configured in the preferences .
The URI to which H.323 incoming calls should be forwarded if configured in the preferences .
H.245 Tunneling is the encapsulation of H.245 messages within H.225 / Q.931 messages ( H.245 Tunneling ) . If you have a firewall and enable H.245 Tunneling , there is one less TCP port that you need to allow for incoming connections .
This enables H.245 early in the setup and permits achieving faster call initiation .
Fast Connect is a new method of call setup that bypasses some usual steps in order to make it faster . In addition to the speed improvement , Fast Connect allows the media channels to be operational before the CONNECT message is sent , which is a requirement for certain billing procedures . It was introduced in H.323 version 2 .

The Session Initiation Protocol ( SIP ) is a protocol developed by the IETF MMUSIC Working Group and proposed standard for initiating , modifying , and terminating an interactive user session that involves multimedia elements such as video , voice , instant messaging , online games , and virtual reality . In November 2000 , SIP was accepted as a 3GPP signaling protocol and permanent element of the IMS architecture . It is one of the leading signalling protocols for Voice over IP .
H.323 was originally created to provide a mechanism for transporting multimedia applications over LANs but it has rapidly evolved to address the growing needs of VoIP networks . One strength of H.323 was the relatively early availability of a set of standards , not only defining the basic call model , but in addition the supplementary services , needed to address business communication expectations . H.323 was the first VoIP standard to adopt the IETF standard RTP to transport audio and video over IP networks . H.323 is based on the ISDN Q.931 protocol and is suited for interworking scenarios between IP and ISDN , respectively between IP and QSIG . A call model , similar to the ISDN call model , eases the introduction of IP Telephony into existing networks of ISDN based PBX systems .
All settings can be changed via the preferences window at anytime .

From the roster or from the call history , simply select Contact -gt ; Message in the main window when a contact is highlighted . From the address book window , simply select Action -gt ; Message when the contact is highlighted . A window pops up , enter your text message , and hit the Enter key .
There are three categories of status messages : online , away and do not disturb . Each of them allows you to specify a more complete status information . Simply select Custom message in the status menu at the bottom of the main window . You can then define your extended status message that will be published using all available protocols supporting it .
Many servers will not support relaying your extended presence information . To make sure that this feature is available with the server you are using or with the PBX you are connected to , please ask your administrator . Please note that Ekiga.net will publish your presence information .
Notice that you need to specify an URI where to forward calls in the preferences to be able to activate that option . Open the preferences window by choosing Edit -gt ; Preferences in the main window and select Call Options on the left . You will now see the appropriate section . It contains three checkboxes for the three cases described above . The URI of the party the calls shall be forwarded to can be configured separately in SIP Settings for SIP and accordingly in H.323 Settings for H.323.
Ending a call : The communication to the remote user can be ended by selecting Chat -gt ; Hang up .
Holding a call : You can hold a remote party call by selecting Chat -gt ; Hold Call . This effectively pauses Video and Audio transmission ; to continue transmission again you select Chat -gt ; Retrieve Call and Video and Audio Transmission will begin again .

If you do not have an Ekiga Call Out account yet , you can subscribe for one using the ' Get an Ekiga.net Call Out account ' link in the dialog . As described above , this service will allow you to call normal phones worldwide at interesting rates . Once the account has been added , you can recharge it , consult the balance history or the call history by selecting the appropriate menu item in the Account menu of the window when the account is highlighted .
SIP URIs are formatted as such " sip : user @ [ host [ : port ] ] "
H.323 URIs are formatted as such " h323 : [ user @ ] [ host [ : port ] ] "
Choosing a higher framerate and a lower quality will have the same result in terms of video bandwidth as choosing a higher quality with a lower framerate . The choice depends on if you prefer using your bandwidth to transmit more lower quality images or fewer high quality images .
When you reorder the codecs , you are reordering the local capabilities table , ie the codecs you will use for sending . You will always transmit audio and video using the first codec in the corresponding table that is in common with the remote user . The remote user will transmit audio and video using the first codec in his table that is common with you .
You can force the use of a specific codec by disabling all other codecs , but it will result in failed calls if the remote user doesn 't support that specific codec . The best approach is to put your preferred codecs at the top of the list so that you always transmit with them if the remote user allows it and to disable the codecs that you don 't want to use for transmission and reception .
You can adjust the delay to wait before playing the sound buffers that you have received using the jitter buffer adjustment . If there is too much packet loss , the delay required to have received all packets could be so important that it will exceed the jitter buffer . In such a case , the sound you are receiving will be of bad quality . A solution to that problem would be to increase the maximum limit of the jitter buffer to a few seconds , resulting in a big delay but in an improved voice quality . Notice that the jitter buffer will readapt itself to the lowest delay allowing for optimum transmission , and that a bad voice quality in reception is not due to a too low jitter buffer value , but to bad internet connection quality .

H.245 Tunneling is the encapsulation of H.245 messages within H.225 / Q.931 messages ( H.245 Tunneling ) . If you have a firewall and enable H.245 Tunneling , there is one less TCP port that you need to allow for incoming connections .
This enables H.245 early in the setup and permits achieving faster call initiation .
Fast Connect is a new method of call setup that bypasses some usual steps in order to make it faster . In addition to the speed improvement , Fast Connect allows the media channels to be operational before the CONNECT message is sent , which is a requirement for certain billing procedures . It was introduced in H.323 version 2 .

This manual describes version 2.18 of Image Viewer .
The collection view allows the viewing and editing of large image collections . In this view image operations can be applied to all selected images at once .
Double-click on an image file in the file manager or other application .
To open an image , perform the following steps :
To view all images in a folder , perform the following steps :
View Full Screen F11 View Slideshow F5 Esc Ctrl W
To scroll around an image that is larger than the image window or full screen view , you can use the following methods :
Use the arrow keys on the keyboard .
Drag the image to move it in the window . ( This means you drag the image in the opposite direction you want to scroll in : to scroll down the image , drag it upwards in the window . )
You can zoom in or out of the image in the following ways :
View Zoom In View Zoom Out View Normal Size View Best Fit
Ctrl + + Ctrl - - Ctrl 0 1 F
When an image is zoomed to fit the window , resizing the window will also change the zoom level , so the image still fits the window .
You can zoom or scroll around the image in the same way as when it is shown in a window , using the mouse or the keyboard .
Space Backspace
Image Viewer View Slideshow F5 P Esc F5 Ctrl W
Name Save Image Save Image Viewer Browse for other folders
You can save multiple images at once : see the next section .
Saving multiple images at once allows you to convert several images to a different format , or give them similar filenames .
Everything but these special tags are considered normal text .
Options Replace spaces with underscores Start counter at
To print an image , perform the following steps :
Images that are too large for the page are automatically scaled down to fit the page . Images that are smaller than the page are centered on it .
Image Viewer 's default toolbar contains only a basic set of items to keep it simple . But you can modify the toolbar if you prefer a different set .
Shows Eye of GNOME toolbar editor window .
It contains the items that are not in the toolbar and the separator item . You can now edit the toolbar :
To add new items to the toolbar , drag them from the toolbar editor to the toolbar .
To remove items from the toolbar , drag them from the toolbar to the toolbar editor .
To rearrange items on the toolbar , drag them to their new position on the toolbar .
To revert your changes to the toolbar and return to the default layout , perform the following steps :
Displays any transparent parts of the image in a check pattern .
Displays any transparent parts of the image in a solid color that you specify . Click on the color selector button to select a color .
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation .
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out or not . This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non interpolated images .
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in or not . This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non extrapolated images .
Determines how transparency should be indicated . Valid values are CHECK _ PATTERN , COLOR and NONE . If COLOR is choosen , then the trans _ color key determines the used color value .
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming or not .
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming . This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event . For example , 0.05 results in a 5 % zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100 % zoom increment .
If the transparency key has the value COLOR , then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency .
Whether or not the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop .
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially .
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically . Zero disables the automatic browsing .
Image collection pane position . Set to 0 for bottom ; 1 for left ; 2 for top ; 3 for right .
Whether the image collection pane should be resizable or not .
Show / hide the image collection pane scroll buttons .
If activated Eye of GNOME wont ask for confirmation when moving images to the trash . It will still ask if any of the files cannot be moved to the trash and would be deleted instead .
Whether the filechooser should show the user 's pictures folder if no images are loaded .
If activated and no image is loaded in the active window , the filechooser will display the user 's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories . If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up it will show the current working directory .
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page .
If activated the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog . This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens , e.g. as used by netbooks . If disabled the widget will be embedded on the " Metadata " page .
List of active plugins . It doesn 't contain the " Location " of the active plugins . See the .eog-plugin file for obtaining the " Location " of a given plugin .

Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation .
The color that is used to fill the area behind the image . If the use-background-color key is not set , the color is determined by the active GTK + theme instead .
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out . This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non-interpolated images .
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in . This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non-extrapolated images .
Determines how transparency should be indicated . Valid values are CHECK _ PATTERN , COLOR and NONE . If COLOR is chosen , then the trans-color key determines the color value used .
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming .
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming . This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event . For example , 0.05 results in a 5 % zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100 % zoom increment .
If the transparency key has the value COLOR , then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency .
If this is active , the color set by the background-color key will be used to fill the area behind the image . If it is not set , the current GTK + theme will determine the fill color .
Whether the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop .
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially .
Delay in seconds until showing the next image
A value greater than 0 determines the seconds an image stays on screen until the next one is shown automatically . Zero disables the automatic browsing .

If activated and no image is loaded in the active window , the file chooser will display the user 's pictures folder using the XDG special user directories . If deactivated or the pictures folder has not been set up , it will show the current working directory .
Whether the metadata list in the properties dialog should have its own page .
If activated , the detailed metadata list in the properties dialog will be moved to its own page in the dialog . This should make the dialog more usable on smaller screens , e.g. as used by netbooks . If disabled , the widget will be embedded on the " Metadata " page .

How to copy / paste from the image viewer into another application .
Make image viewer the default application for viewing pictures .
If you want to make the image viewer the default program that opens certain image file types :
Image Viewer Recommended Applications Show other applications Image Viewer Set as default
In future , when you double-click a file of the same type , it will open up in the image viewer .
Set your favorite picture as your desktop background / wallpaper .
The image viewer can only be used to view pictures ; it can 't edit them . For that , you must use a picture editing application , like the GIMP image editor . To open a picture for editing in a different application :
Select the application you want to use to edit the picture .
When you are finished editing , save it and close the other application .
Edit Move to Trash Move to Trash
Horizontal / vertical , clockwise / counter-clockwise
If your pictures are the wrong way up or back-to-front , you can flip or rotate them so that they look right .
Otherwise , don 't save the picture and it will be returned to its original orientation the next time you open it .

You can convert pictures from one image format to another . You can do this in a batch for multiple pictures .
Pictures are saved in a specific file format , like JPEG or PNG . You can convert from one file format to another .
Convert a single picture to a different file format
You can convert a number of pictures from one file format to another in one go . This is useful if you have a lot of pictures that need converting .
The image viewer can save pictures in the following file formats :
It may be possible to save other image formats depending on the system configuration .

View information such as camera settings and histogram , geolocation , and date .
Pictures taken by digital cameras are stored with a host of extra information embedded in them , such as the date that they were taken , what exposure settings were used on the camera and , in some cases , even where the picture was taken .
This topic shows you how to access this information .
You can display the date that a picture was taken in the status bar at the bottom of the window .
Exif display Plugins Preferences Display camera settings in statusbar
The map will show the location that a picture was taken in only if there is geolocation information attached to the photo . Many cameras do not attach geolocation information to pictures .
If you like , you can change the background color in fullscreen mode .
Now , when in fullscreen mode , the background color is the one you selected .

The toolbar provides easy access to features like zooming and rotating . You can hide it if you find it distracting or it it takes up too much room , however .
Add , remove and rearrange the tools in the toolbar .
By default , the toolbar contains only a basic set of tools . You can add useful extra ones by modifying the toolbar :
Make sure that the toolbar is not hidden .
If you have a folder containing several pictures , you can conveniently browse through all of the pictures without having to open them individually .

Click on a picture in the gallery to show it full-size .
You can zoom in and out to show more or less of a picture on the screen at once . This is useful if you want to see a big picture in its entirety , or if you want to inspect the fine details of a picture .
You can zoom using the mouse wheel . Scroll up to zoom in or scroll down to zoom out .
Whether the image should be rotated automatically based on EXIF orientation .
The color that is used to fill the area behind the image . If the use-background-color key is not set , the color is determined by the active GTK + theme instead .
Whether the image should be interpolated on zoom-out . This leads to better quality but is somewhat slower than non-interpolated images .
Whether the image should be extrapolated on zoom-in . This leads to blurry quality and is somewhat slower than non-extrapolated images .
Determines how transparency should be indicated . Valid values are CHECK _ PATTERN , COLOR and NONE . If COLOR is chosen , then the trans-color key determines the color value used .
Whether the scroll wheel should be used for zooming .
The multiplier to be applied when using the mouse scroll wheel for zooming . This value defines the zooming step used for each scroll event . For example , 0.05 results in a 5 % zoom increment for each scroll event and 1.00 result in a 100 % zoom increment .
If the transparency key has the value COLOR , then this key determines the color which is used for indicating transparency .
If this is active , the color set by the background-color key will be used to fill the area behind the image . If it is not set , the current GTK + theme will determine the fill color .
Whether the sequence of images should be shown in an endless loop .
If this is set to FALSE small images will not be stretched to fit into the screen initially .

How to copy / paste from the image viewer into another application .
Make image viewer the default application for viewing pictures .
If you want to make the image viewer the default program that opens certain image file types :
Image Viewer Recommended Applications Show other applications Image Viewer Set as default
In future , when you double-click a file of the same type , it will open up in the image viewer .
Set your favorite picture as your desktop background / wallpaper .
The image viewer can only be used to view pictures ; it can 't edit them . For that , you must use a picture editing application , like the GIMP image editor . To open a picture for editing in a different application :
Select the application you want to use to edit the picture .
When you are finished editing , save it and close the other application .
Edit Move to Trash Move to Trash
Horizontal / vertical , clockwise / counter-clockwise
If your pictures are the wrong way up or back-to-front , you can flip or rotate them so that they look right .
Otherwise , don 't save the picture and it will be returned to its original orientation the next time you open it .
external ref = ' figures / multiple-convert.png ' md5 = ' 18e33232ab342016df8a58b1a42e4942 '
You can convert pictures from one image format to another . You can do this in a batch for multiple pictures .
Pictures are saved in a specific file format , like JPEG or PNG . You can convert from one file format to another .
Convert a single picture to a different file format
You can convert a number of pictures from one file format to another in one go . This is useful if you have a lot of pictures that need converting .
The image viewer can save pictures in the following file formats :
It may be possible to save other image formats depending on the system configuration .
The image viewer can display pictures in a wide range of image formats , including PNG , JPEG , and TIFF .
The image viewer is able to open pictures in the following formats :
Could not load image ' image _ name ' .

View information such as camera settings and histogram , geolocation , and date .
Pictures taken by digital cameras are stored with a host of extra information embedded in them , such as the date that they were taken , what exposure settings were used on the camera and , in some cases , even where the picture was taken .
This topic shows you how to access this information .
You can display the date that a picture was taken in the status bar at the bottom of the window .
Exif display Plugins Preferences Display camera settings in statusbar
The map will show the location that a picture was taken in only if there is geolocation information attached to the photo . Many cameras do not attach geolocation information to pictures .
If you like , you can change the background color in fullscreen mode .
Now , when in fullscreen mode , the background color is the one you selected .
external ref = ' figures / prefs-plugins-fullscreen.png ' md5 = ' fa4a5c0f4e8f9abe291c0342eb1ff177 '
Activate fullscreen mode by double-clicking a picture .
If you like , you can make it so that pictures are shown full-screen when you double-click them in the image viewer .
Now , double-clicking on an image will toggle between the fullscreen and normal ( window ) modes .
Easily upload pictures to PicasaWeb directly from the Image Viewer .
The Python console can be used to add extra functions and run scripts in the image viewer .

From now on , contacts will be automatically created for senders of received mail when you reply to that mail .
Autocompletion of names and email addresses entered in the mail composer .
Use the online address book of your Google account .
Use shared address books on a local network .
The LDAP protocol was created to let users share contact information over a network by sharing access to a central directory . LDAP allows a company to maintain a shared set of contact information . Many companies keep a common LDAP address book for all their employees or for client contacts .
Enter the address of the server , the port number ( the default number is 389 ) and whether you want to connect securely .
Define the login method and your user name .
Search Base : The search base is the starting point for a directory search . Contact your system administrator for information about the correct settings .
Search Scope : The search scope is the breadth of a given search . The following options are available :
One : Searches the Search Base and one entry below it .
Sub : Searches the Search Base and all entries below it .
Search Filter : The search filter can be set here for all the LDAP queries . For example :
Filter ( | ( ObjectClass = User ) ( ObjectClass = groupOfNames ) )
( amp ; ( mail = * ) ( ObjectClass = * ) )
Download Limit : The maximum number of results for a given search . Most servers refuse to send more than 500 contacts , but you can set the number lower if you want to shorten downloads for very broad searches .
If you are unsure about some settings , ask your system administrator .
LDAP address books work like local address books on your computer , with the following exceptions :
Network folders are only available when you are connected to the network . If you use a laptop or have a modem connection , you might want to copy or cache some of the network directory . You do this by dragging and dropping your desired contacts into the local address books .
You can also mark the network folder for offline usage . To mark the folder , right-click the folder , click Properties and select Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation .

On address books , searching , contact lists , and categories .
There are several ways how to organize your contacts . You can use several addressbooks and categories , and for conveniently sending messages to a group of people contact lists are available .
In the Contacts view , you can quickly search for contacts either by category or by contact 's info .
File New Contact New Contact … Shift Ctrl C
Enter the contact information . Note that there are several tabs .
You can also add a contact directly from an email .
Right-click on the email address in the message header .
If you want to change a contact that already exists in your address books ,
On adding , editing , and deleting contacts in address books .
A contact list is a set of contacts with a single nickname that you create . When you send mail to this nickname it is actually sent to every member of the list . This differs from a " real " mailing list in that it exists only on your computer as a convenience to you , rather than as an actual email address managed by a mailing list application on a server .
For example , you could create one contact for each family member , then add those contacts to a contact list called " Family " . Then , instead of entering each person 's email address individually , you can send emails to " Family " and the messages would go to all of them .
Choose whether you want to hide the email addresses when you send a message to the list .
Adding different types of address books and using more than one address book .
You can have multiple address books . For example , you might have one address book for work related contacts and one for private contacts . The side bar lists those address books , and you can select which address book is shown .
You can also use address books that are not on your computer , such as on the internet ( e.g. Google ) or in a local network ( e.g. LDAP ) .

Choose the destination ( e.g. the folder or calendar in Evolution ) for the imported data .
Repeat the import steps until you have imported all your data .
These steps refer to locally stored data such as POP accounts . For remote data ( like IMAP ) this is not necessary , since the data is still on the server and does not need to be manually transfered . You can set up the corresponding account in Evolution and the data will be downloaded .
First , while using Microsoft Windows , prepare your messages for import :
C : \ \ Users \ \ username \ \ My Documents \ \ Outlook Files
C : \ \ Documents and Settings \ \ username \ \ My Documents \ \ Outlook Files
C : \ \ Users \ \ username \ \ AppData \ \ Local \ \ Microsoft \ \ Outlook
C : \ \ Documents and Settings \ \ username \ \ AppData \ \ Local \ \ Microsoft \ \ Outlook
( Replace " username " by your username . )
Copy the Outlook files to the system or partition that Evolution is installed on .
As your Windows hard drive is probably in the NTFS format , some Linux systems cannot read it without additional software . You might find it simpler to copy the mail folders to a USB drive or to burn a CD .
Depending on your last step , either plug in the disk or USB drive with the data and wait until the file manager window opens , or mount your Windows drive .
Copy all the mail files into your home directory or another convenient place .
Choose the Outlook personal folders ( .pst ) file that you would like to import .
Choose the destination ( e.g. the folder in Evolution ) for the imported data .
To import single files ( mail , calendar data or contacts ) :
You can also import contacts that you have received as a vCard attachment of an email from its attachment menu .
Evolution can import the following types of files :
Berkeley Mailbox ( .mbox or no extension ) :
The email format used by Mozilla , Netscape , Evolution ( for local folders until version 2.32 ) , Eudora , and many other email clients .
Outlook Express 5 / 6 Personal Folders ( .dbx ) :
The email file format used by Microsoft Outlook Express 5 / 6 . For newer versions PST import is recommended .
A format for storing calendar files , which is generally used by Evolution , Microsoft Outlook , Sunbird , and Korganizer .
A format for storing calendar files. iCalendar is used by Evolution , Microsoft Outlook , Palm OS handhelds , and others .
The address book format used by the GNOME , KDE , and many other contact management applications . You should be able to export to vCard format from any address book application .
Evolution / Mozilla / Outlook CSV / Tab ( .csv , .tab ) :
CSV ( Comma-separated values ) or Tabulator files saved by using Evolution , Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla .
A file format used to store local copies of messages , calendar events , and other items within Microsoft software such as Microsoft Exchange Client , Windows Messaging , and Microsoft Outlook . It is also called " Personal Storage Table " .

Handling of file attachments for writing and reading mail
Saving and opening files that are attached to received emails .
Evolution does not support saving all attachments of all messages in one folder at once .
A list of attachments is also available at the bottom of the email .
To open an attachment in another application , click the down-arrow next to the attachment icon and choose one of the available applications .
Attaching files to emails you want to send .
To attach a file to your email in the composer :
You can also drag a file to the attachment bar of the composer window .
When you send the message , a copy of the attached file goes with it . Be aware that large attachments can take a long time to send and receive .
Evolution has an Attachment Reminder plugin you can use to remind yourself to attach a file to an email . If it determines that you have not attached the file , it displays a reminder window before the email is sent .
Based on the keywords you have added , Evolution searches the text of every mail you are going to send . If it finds any of the keywords in your email and there is no actual attached file , the reminder window is displayed .
Sending invitations for appointments to contacts via email .
If you create an event in the calendar component , you can then send invitations to the attendee list through the Evolution email tool . The invitation card is sent as an attachment in iCal format .
When you receive an invitation , you have several options :
Indicates you will attend the meeting . When you click the OK button , the meeting is entered into your calendar .
Indicates you will probably attend the meeting . When you click the OK button , the meeting is entered into your calendar , but is marked as tentative .
Indicates you are unable to attend the meeting . The meeting is not entered into your calendar when you click OK , although your response is sent to the meeting host if you have selected the Send reply to sender option .
Select this option if you want your response sent to the meeting organizers .

To set up the Custom Header plugin :
You can add , edit , or remove the header fields . For every header field you add , you can specify the keys and values . The key is used as the title of the Custom Header . You can enter multiple values for the keys . You must use a semicolon to separate every value you enter .
Set the values for the header fields by using the dropdown list .
Edit Preferences Composer Preferences Default Behavior Format messages in HTML
When you receive an email , you can forward it to other individuals or groups that might be interested .
Attachment forwarding is best if you want to send the full , unaltered message to someone else . Inline or Quoted forwarding is best if you want to send portions of a message , or if you have a large number of comments on different sections of the message you are forwarding .
To forward a message that you are reading :
Message Forward Forward Ctrl F Message Forward as Forward
Select a recipient for the message . The subject is already entered , although you can alter it if you want .
Add your comments on the message in the text field .
Attachments to a message you are forwarding are forwarded only when you send the original message as an attachment . Inline messages do not forward any attachments .

If you have a signature for your account defined but exceptionally do not want to use it for one message , or want to use a different signature , you can change it via the dropdown menu in the right upper corner in the email composer window .
A message template is a standard message that you can use at any time to send mail with the same pattern .
Use one of your templates for replying to a message
Select the message template of your choice . Make changes if required in the email composer window that will open .
When you select a message template for replying , the subject of the reply is preserved .
Store an existing or new message as a template
You can also edit an existing message and save it as a template :
Edit the message body or the addresses according to your requirements .
Configure variables in templates and reuse items from the message you reply to
You can add , edit or remove the key-value pairs . You can specify any number of key-value pairs .
In any template , the occurrence of every $ key is replaced by the value it has in the configuration . For example , if you set the key to Manager and the value to Harry , any occurrence of $ Manager is replaced by Harry in the message .
Assume that you have 1000 message templates with your current manager 's name in them . When the current manager is replaced by a new one , it is not easy for you to manually replace the manager 's name in all the 1000 messages . If the messages have a $ Manager key value , you can reset the value in the Configuration tab of this plugin .
By default , the entire environment variables are used as a key-value pair . An occurrence of $ env _ variable is replaced by the value it carries . For example , an occurrence of $ PATH in your template is replaced by its value when the template is used .
The replacement process uses the following order of precedence :
$ key is replaced by the value set for it in the Configuration tab of the Templates plugin .
If the key is not found , it is then replaced with the value of its environment variable .
If key is neither a configuration option nor an environment variable , no changes are made .
Using Elements From a Message in a Template When Replying
$ ORIG [ header _ name ] header _ name $ ORIG [ subject ] $ ORIG [ body ]
$ ORIG [ body ] $ ORIG [ reply-to ]
Change font alignment and paragraph formatting in the mail composer .
Located next to the Headers and Lists dropdown , the three paragraph icons should be familiar to users of most word processing software . The left-most button aligns your text to the left , the center button centers text , and the right button aligns the text to the right .
The button with the arrow pointing left decreases a paragraph 's indentation , and the right arrow increases its indentation .
Setting a priority for messages to be sent .
Evolution will ignore the message priority of incoming messages because the recipient should decide whether the message is important or not . You can set the " Important " flag for any messages .

When someone sends you HTML mail that includes an image in the body of the message ( for example , the welcome message in your Inbox ) , Evolution displays the image inside the message .
Some images are links in a message , rather than being part of the message . Evolution can download those images from the Internet , but does not do so unless you request it . This is because remotely hosted images can be slow to load and display , and can even be used by spammers to track who reads the email . Not automatically loading images helps protect your privacy .

If you want , you can upload your keys to a key server :
Key servers store your public keys for you so that your friends can decrypt your messages . If you choose not to use a key server , you can manually send your public key , include it in your signature file , or put it on your own Web page . However , it is easier to publish a key once , and then let people download it from a central place when they want .
If you don 't have a key to unlock or encrypt a message , you can set your encryption tool to look it up automatically . If it cannot find the key , an error message appears .
Decrypting and checking the signature of received GPG messages .
If you receive an encrypted message , you need to decrypt it before you can read it .
When you view the message , Evolution prompts you for your PGP password . Enter it , and the unencrypted message is displayed .
Senders must have your GPG public key before they can send you an encrypted message .
To send an encrypted message , you need to use the recipient 's public key in combination with your private key . Evolution handles the encryption , but you need to get the public key and add it to your keyring .

Forwards the message to another email address .
Filters messages according the server you got them from . This is most useful if you use multiple POP mail accounts .
Evolution can use an external command to process a message , then process it based on the return value . Commands used in this way must return an integer . This is most commonly used to add an external junk mail filter .
Applies an action always to any message , without further conditions . This could be useful at the end of the list of message filters to cover those emails that did not match any conditions for the preceding filters in the list .
Fix problems with mail filters that do not sort and organize mail as expected .
The order of filters is very important . They are applied to the original message in sequence , like a recipe .
When you move a message to another folder , " moving " actually means appending a copy of the message to the destination folder and marking the original message for deletion . So any subsequent filter rules will be applied to the original message that is now marked for deletion . Therefore moving a message should usually appear last in a sequence of filter rules .
Another thing you have to keep in mind is that filters depend on the " new " flag that is set on the server when a particular email message is initially fetched from the server . If you use another email client aside from Evolution , your filters may not work automatically .
If it is still unclear why filters do not work as expected , you can enable logging filter actions .
gsettings set org.gnome.evolution.mail filters-log-file " / home / myusername / my-filter-log " myusername my-filter-log ~ $ HOME
Use filter rules to sort your mail automatically into folders .
Message filters apply actions on messages based on conditions that you have defined . You can define filters for both incoming and outgoing emails .
Edit Preferences Mail Accounts Edit Receiving Options Options Apply filters to new messages in Inbox on this server
Define the conditions for the rule . For each condition , you first select which part of the message will be checked and then define the comparison .
The order of filters is important . Filters are applied to the original message in sequence , like a recipe .
Evolution , like most mail systems , uses folders to store email messages . You start out with a few mail folders such as the Inbox , Outbox , and Drafts . You can , however , create more folders if required .
Specify the name and the location of the folder .
The new folder will be shown in the folder view . You can then move messages into the folder .
The Inbox folders on most IMAP servers cannot contain both messages and subfolders . When creating additional folders on your IMAP mail server , branch the folders from the root of the IMAP account and not from the Inbox . Creating subfolders in your Inbox may prevent you from reading messages that exist in the Inbox . If this happens , move the folders to the IMAP account .
You can move messages into folders by using one of the following methods :
Drag and drop the messages into the folder .
To make sure you do not forget about a message , you can use the follow-up feature .
Right-click one of the messages .
Message Mark as Follow Up ... Shift Ctrl G
A window opens to allow you to set the type of flag and the due date .
The flag itself is the action you want to remind yourself about , such as Call , Forward and Reply .
When you read a flagged message , its flag status is displayed at the top , before the message headers . An overdue message might tell you " Overdue : Call by April 07 , 2012 , 5 : 00 PM . "
If you have accounts on multiple servers , select the server where you want to manage your subscriptions .
Evolution displays a list of files and folders available on the IMAP server .

Possible reasons why emails are not sent .
There can be several reasons why emails are not sent :
Invalid email address . Check if all the addresses listed as mail recipients are correct . If the message contains a wrong or invalid email address , the message will not be sent .
Incorrect SMTP settings . Verify if the settings used for outgoing messages is correct . Using the incorrect server address or authentication method may prevent emails from being sent

Navigating in a folder 's unread mail in the message list
When you are in the Mail window , the Spacebar has the following behavior :
When you press the Spacebar for the first time , it takes you to the next unread message .
If you press the Spacebar after you reach the bottom of the page , it takes you to the next unread message .
If there are no more unread messages in the mailbox , pressing the Spacebar takes you to the next unread message in the next folder .
If new messages arrive in a number of folders , the Spacebar toggles between those folders . This feature allows you to switch to the next unread message in a different folder without clicking the folder .
Read receipts are a way for people to acknowledge that they have received your email . The recipient can normally choose whether to acknowledge the receipt or not , so they are not a completely reliable way of checking if your emails have been received by someone .

Search folders mail folder list Edit Preferences Mail Accounts Search Folders
Use search folders to see messages in one folder while still keeping them in their original folders .
Evolution automatically updates the search folder contents when new messages are received or message are deleted .
It might happen that one of your Search folders has not updated since some new email arrived or since an email was deleted , for example . This will mean that the list of emails in the folder is not up-to-date .
There currently is no way to do search for emails with a specific type of attachment ( for example searching for all emails that have a PDF attachment ) .
In the mail view , you can quickly search for messages by defining conditions .
Select the scope from the drop-down list right to the text box .

Sorting the message list of a mail folder .
This feature , when enabled , groups replies with the original email and allows you to follow the flow of the conversation from one message to the next .
When a new message arrives , it will be added below the parent message . Threads are sorted and displayed based on the date of the most recent message received .
The message list displays columns that indicate whether a message has been read , whether it has attachments , how important the message is , the sender , date , and the subject . To change the columns used in the message list , you can do one of the following :
Right-click on the header .
Evolution allows you to sort your messages using these columns . Just click on the column label to sort the emails . The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates the direction of the sort .
Evolution provides other ways for sorting email messages . You can use Sort By , Sort Ascending , Sort Descending , or Unsort .
Right-click on the message list column headers .
This brings up this list of criteria for sorting email messages :
Select the option you wish to use in sorting email messages .
The messages will be displayed with the most recent at the bottom .
The messages will be displayed with the most recent at the top .
This removes sorting from the column , reverting to the order of messages as they were added to the folder .
How to mark unwanted junk and spam mail .
Junk Mark as Not Junk Shift Ctrl J Not Junk
How to set up handling unwanted junk / spam mail .
You can modify how Evolution handles junk mail by changing the Junk Mail Preferences :
Deleting junk messages upon exit , and how often junk messages are to be deleted .
Marking messages as not junk if the sender is in the address book .
How to have only one trash or junk folder per account .
Two Trash or Junk folders shown for the same account
If you use a remote mail account that also has Junk and / or Trash folders on the server you might face duplicated folders in Evolution .

Changing the mail view for widescreen displays .
Evolution provides a vertical view in addition to the classical view . In the vertical view , the message preview pane is located at the right side of the message list when compared to the classical view where the message preview pane is placed below the message list . Vertical view enables you to use the extra width of wide screen monitors .
In vertical view , the message list contains double lines of compressed headers , which enables you to consume the extra width in the preview column . The compressed columns have Sender Name and Email , Attachment Icon , Date and Subject in the second line .
Words are wrapped in outgoing mails at 72 characters .
Words are wrapped in outgoing mails at 72 characters
For better readability lines are wrapped after 72 characters . This value is hardcoded and cannot be changed .
Work with your mail while not being connected to the network .
Forced offline mode helps you communicate with remote mail storage systems like GroupWise , IMAP or Exchange , in situations where you are not connected to the network at all times . Evolution keeps a local copy of one or more folders to allow you to compose messages , storing them in your Outbox to be sent the next time you connect .
Evolution 's forced offline mode only refers to mail and does not apply to contacts and calendars .
POP mail downloads all messages to your local system , but other connections usually download just the headers , and get the rest only when you want to read the message . Before you force Evolution to be offline , Evolution downloads the unread messages from the folders you have chosen to store .
To mark a mail folder for offline use ,
Evolution automatically understands the network state and acts accordingly . For instance , Evolution switches to offline mode when the network goes down and automatically switches on when the network is up again .
In the Memos view , you can quickly search for memos either by summary or by category .
If you just want to quickly add a memo by entering a summary you can directly enter it in the list of memos .
Shared Memos are like mail messages except they are scheduled for a particular day and appear on the calendar for that date . You can use shared memos to show vacations , holidays , pay days , birthdays , and so on . Posted shared memos are placed in your Calendar on the date you specify . They are not placed in your Mailbox or in any other user 's Mailbox .
Select the Organizer 's account name from the drop-down list given next to the Organizer field .
In the To field , type a username , then press Enter . Repeat this for additional users .
Enter a brief summary in the Summary field .

Synchronize Evolution data with handheld devices and mobile phones .
There are currently no " recommended instructions " for users .
To synchronize with a Palm OS device like the PalmPilot ( TM ) and the Handspring Visor several steps are needed : First , you need to enable synchronization . Second , your computer needs to recognize and access your handheld . Third , you should decide what sort of synchronization behavior you want .
Edit GNOME Pilot Synchronization ... / dev / pilot / dev / ttyS0 / dev / ttyUSB1 ttyUSB0 ttyUSB1
Use the following procedure to synchronize the data on your Palm OS device with the data you store in Evolution .
If you use Palm OS version 4.0 and have password protection turned on for your handheld device , you might encounter trouble synchronizing . If this happens , try turning off password protection on your handheld , synchronize it with your desktop computer , and then re-enable password protection on your handheld .
Now your Palm OS device will synchronize data with Evolution .
Using an online CalDAV task list or memo list .
To add such a task list or memo list to Evolution , perform the following steps :
Choose if you want to be able to view the content also while offline .
The task list will be added to the list of task lists in Evolution .
Options for displaying task completion and due dates .
Select the color for tasks due today .
Select this option to have completed tasks hidden after a period of time measured in days , hours , or minutes . If you do not select this option , completed tasks remain in your task list , marked as complete .
To add another local task list to Evolution , perform the following steps :
On task and memo lists , searching , and categories .
In the Tasks view , you can quickly search for tasks either by summary or by category .
If you just want to quickly add a task by entering a summary you can directly enter it in the list of tasks .
Evolution can be used to assign a task to multiple people .
When you assign a task , you can specify the attendees in several categories , such as " chair " or " required " . When you save the task , each attendee is sent an email with the task information , which also gives them the option to respond .
If you want to change a task that already exists in your task lists ,
On adding , editing , and deleting tasks .
Adding and using more than one task list or memo list .
You can have multiple task or memo lists and choose which of your lists get displayed . For example , you might have tasks for work , tasks for home , and tasks for the singing club of which you are a member . The side bar shows these lists , and you can select or deselect any of the boxes next to them to show and hide the corresponding tasks or memos in your view .
Tasks and memos from each task or memo list appear as different colors .
You can also use lists that are not on your computer , such as on the internet .
Using an online WebDAV task list or memo list .
Using and managing categories for appointments , contacts , memos and tasks .
Another way to group contacts , appointments , tasks and memos ( summarized by the term " objects " in the following text ) is to mark them as belonging to different categories . You can mark an object as being in several categories or no category at all . For example in your address book , you put a friend in the " Business " category because he works with you and the " Friends " category because he is a friend .
To mark an object as belonging to a category ,
Double-click the object to bring up the corresponding editor .
Select the category from the list . You can select as many or as few categories as you like .
Double-click any object to bring up the corresponding editor .
Enter the new category in the entry box at the top .
The sender 's email address or the name of the sender .
Only the BCC recipients of the message . Obviously this can only be applied to outgoing filters .
The sender 's email address or the name of the sender or the recipients of the message .
If a message uses a header more than once , Evolution pays attention only to the first instance , even if the message defines the header differently the second time . For example , if a message declares the Resent-From : header as " engineering @ example.com " and then restates it as " marketing @ example.com " , Evolution filters as though the second declaration did not occur . To filter on messages that use headers multiple times , use a regular expression .
Searches in the actual text of the message .
Filters messages according to the date on which they were sent . First , choose the conditions you want a message to meet , such as before a given time or after a given time . Then choose the time . The filter compares the message 's time stamp to the system clock when the filter is run , or to a specific time and date you choose from a calendar . You can also have it look for a message within a range of time relative to the filter , such as two to four days ago .
This works the same way as the Date Sent option , except that it compares the time you received the message with the dates you specify .
Sets the message score to any whole number greater than 0 . You can have one filter set or change a message score , and then set up another filter to move the messages you have scored . A message score is not based on anything in particular : it is simply a number you can assign to messages so other filters can process them .
Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes .
Filters according to the status of a message . The status can be Replied To , Draft , Important , Read , or Junk .
Checks whether there is an attachment for the email .
Filters based on the mailing list the message came from . This filter might miss messages from some list servers , because it checks for the X-BeenThere header , which is used to identify mailing lists or other redistributors of mail . Mail from list servers that do not set X-BeenThere properly are not be caught by these filters .
Here you define your name and your email address .
Optionally you can make this account your default account ( e.g. when writing emails ) , set a Reply-To email address ( if you want replies to messages sent to a different address ) , and set an organization ( the company where you work , or the organization you represent when you send email from this account ) .
Select the condition from the dropdown list , and then type a search entry in the field .
If you search for something rather often , you will prefer not to type it many times . In this case you can use saved searches .
Edit the title or search conditions from the dialog box .

Importing Mail ( Optional ) Using Evolution : An Overview
Microsoft Outlook * and versions of Outlook Express after version 4 use proprietary formats that Evolution cannot read or import .
Before importing email from Netscape * , Mozilla and Netscape users need to click File & gt ; Compact & gt ; All Folders from within the Netscape or Mozilla mail tool . Otherwise , Evolution imports and undeletes the messages in your Trash folders .
Contacts files are stored in a database , but can be saved as a standard vCard * . To export an address book , click File & gt ; Save Address Book As VCard " . If you want to export only one contact , click File & gt ; Save Contact as VCard .
Now that the first-run configuration has finished , you 're ready to begin using Evolution . Here 's a quick explanation of what 's happening in your main Evolution window .
The folder list gives you a list of the available folders for each account . To see the contents of a folder , click the folder name and the contents are displayed in the message list .
The toolbar gives you fast and easy access to the frequently used features in each component .
The search tool lets you search your email , contacts , calendar , and tasks to easily find what you 're looking for .
The message list displays a list of email that you have received . To view an email in the preview pane , click the email in the message list .
The switcher at the bottom of the side bar lets you switch between the Evolution tools - Mail , Contacts , Calendars , Memos and Tasks .
The status bar periodically displays a message , or tells you the progress of a task . This most often happens when you 're checking or sending email . These progress queues are shown in the previous figure . The Online / Offline indicator is here , too , in the lower left of the window .
The preview pane displays the contents of the email that is selected in the message list .
The menu bar 's contents always provide all the possible actions for any given view of your data . If you 're looking at your Inbox , most of the menu items relate to email . Some content relates to other components of Evolution and some , especially in the File menu , relates to the application as a whole .
Anything related to a file or to the operations of the application is listed in this menu , such as creating things , saving them to disk , printing them , and quitting the program itself .
Holds useful tools that help you edit text and move it around . Also lets you access the settings and configuration options .
Lets you decide how Evolution should look . Some of the features control the appearance of Evolution as a whole , and others the way a particular kind of information appears .
Holds actions that can be performed on folders . You can find things like copy , rename , delete , and so on .
Holds actions that can be applied to a message . If there is only one target for the action , such as replying to a message , you can normally find it in the Message menu .
Lets you search for messages , or for phrases within a message . You can also see previous searches you have made . In addition to the Search menu , there is a text entry box in the toolbar that you can use to search for messages . You can also create a search folder from a search .
The Sidebar is the vertical panel on the left side of the Evolution main window . At the bottom of the Sidebar is the Switcher . This lets you switch between different Evolution tools like Mail , Memo , Tasks , and Contacts . Above the Switcher is a list of folders related to the current Evolution tool .
If you get large amounts of email , you might want more folders than just your Inbox . You can also create multiple calendar , task , or contacts folders .
Click Folder & gt ; New .
Type the name of the folder in the Folder Name field .
Select the location of the new folder .
Displays buttons with the label and the icon corresponding to it .
Displays buttons with the label , not the icons .
Shows buttons using the desktop toolbar settings .
This option hides all the shortcut buttons of switcher .
Right-click a folder or subfolder to display a menu with the following options :
Copies the folder to a different location . When you select this item , Evolution offers a choice of locations to copy the folder to .
Moves the folder to another location . When you select this item , Evolution offers a choice of locations to move the folder to .
Marks all the messages in the folder as read .
Lets you change the name of the folder .
Checks the number of total and unread messages in a folder , and , for remote folders , lets you select whether to copy the folder to your local system for offline operation .
You can also rearrange folders and messages by dragging and dropping them .
Any time new email arrives in a email folder , that folder label is displayed in bold text , along with the number of new messages in that folder .
Evolution email is like other email programs in several ways :
It can send and receive email in HTML or as plain text , and makes it easy to send and receive multiple file attachments .
It can sort and organize your email in a wide variety of ways with folders , searches , and filters .
It lets you guard your privacy with encryption .
junk email filtering searching search folder
The message list displays all the messages that you have . This includes all your read and unread messages , and email that is flagged to be deleted .
The preview pane displays the message that is currently chosen in the message list .
If you find the preview pane too small , you can resize the pane , enlarge the whole window , or double-click the message in the message list to have it open in a new window . To change the size of a pane , drag the divider between the two panes .
As with folders , you can right-click messages in the message list and get a menu of possible actions , including moving or deleting them , creating filters or search folders based on them , and marking them as junk mail .
Most of the email-related actions you want to perform are listed in the Message menu and Folder menu in the menu bar . The most frequently used ones , like Reply and Forward , also appear as buttons in the toolbar . Most of them are also located in the right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts .
To begin using the calendar , click Calendar in the Switcher . By default , the calendar shows today 's schedule on a ruled background . At the left bottom , there is a monthly calendar you can use to switch days . At the upper right , there is a task list , where you can keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments . Below that , there is a memo list .
The appointment list displays all your scheduled appointments .
The month pane is a small view of a calendar month . To display additional months , drag the column border to the right . You can also select a range of days in the month pane to display a custom range of days in the appointment list .
Tasks are distinct from appointments because they generally don 't have times associated with them . You can use the list in a larger window by clicking the Tasks button in the side bar .
To use the contacts tool , click Contacts in the Switcher . By default , the display shows all your contacts in alphabetical order , in a minicard view . You can select other views from the View menu , and adjust the width of the columns by clicking and dragging the gray column dividers .
Another advantage of the Evolution contacts is its integration with the rest of the application . For example , you can right-click an email address in Evolution mail to instantly create a contact entry .
The largest section of the contacts display shows a list of individual contacts . You can also search the contacts in the same way that you search email folders , using the search tool on the right side of the toolbar .
With the Backup and Restore plugin enabled , you can successfully back up Evolution to your machine and restore it whenever it is required . The backup saves your Evolution settings , mail , contacts , tasks , memos , and calendars and creates an archive .
Select File & gt ; Backup Settings to select the folder where you want to save the backup .
Evolution is always backed up as evolution-backup.tar.gz.
Before the backup process starts , it asks you to close Evolution and displays a warning as shown below :
Select Restart Evolution after backup to restart Evolution immediately after the backup process .
Click Yes to close Evolution and start the backup .
Evolution will auto-restart after the process .
This feature restores your settings from the archive .
Select File & gt ; Restore Settings to open the available evolution-backup.tar.gz files .
Select the evolution-backup.tar.gz and click Save .
Before the process starts , a pop-up window appears and asks you to close Evolution . Close all the windows and then click Restore in the pop-up window .
If you are creating your first account via the Startup Wizard , you can use the option to restore from the archive if it is available locally .
Disables all the preview panes when you launch Evolution .
This prevents Evolution from opening the most recently selected message , task or contact , thus providing a way to avoid an application crash caused by previewing the message , task or contact .
Starts Evolution and begins composing a message to the email address listed .
Forces every part of Evolution to shut down immediately .
Makes Evolution your default email handler for your Web browser and in the GNOME * Control Center .
If you are not already viewing mail , switch to the mail tool by clicking the Mail shortcut button , or press Ctrl + 1 . To read a message , select it in the message list ; if you 'd like to see it in its own window , either double-click it , press Enter , or press Ctrl + O.
To read mail with the keyboard , you can click the Spacebar to page down and press Backspace to page up while reading an email . Ensure that you use the keys when the message list is enabled .
Navigate the message list by using the arrow keys on the keyboard . To go to the next and previous unread messages , press the period ( . ) or comma ( , ) keys . On some keyboards , these keys are also marked with the & gt ; and & lt ; symbols , which is a convenient way to remember that they move you forward and backward in your message list . You can also use the right square bracket ( ] ) for the next unread message , and the left square bracket ( [ ) for the previous unread message .
With Magic Spacebar , you can easily read the unread messages in all the mail folders . You can read mail , scroll through mail and switch folders by using the Spacebar on your keyboard .
To enable Magic Spacebar :
Select Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select Mail Accounts .
Select the Enable Magic Spacebar check box .
When you are in the Mail view , the Spacebar has the following behavior :
When you press the Spacebar for the first time , it takes you to the next unread message .
If the message is more than one screen long , the Spacebar works as Page Down key .
If you press the Spacebar after you reach the bottom of the page , it takes you to the next unread message .
If there are no more unread messages in the mailbox , pressing the Spacebar takes you to the next unread message in the next folder .
If new messages arrive in a number of folders , the Spacebar toggles between those folders . This feature allows you to switch to the next unread message in a different folder without clicking the folder .
If this is your first time checking mail , or you haven 't asked Evolution to store your password , you are prompted for the password . Enter your password to download your email .
Mail Header Preferences
Evolution can notify you of new messages . When you receive a new message in your inbox , a blinking icon appears on the Switcher .
To enable this feature , select Edit & gt ; Plugins , then select the Mail Notification check box . You can configure the plugin by specifing the following in the Plugin Manager .
Select this option to restrict the mail notification to Inbox . With this option enabled , you are notified of each new message arrival in the Inbox .
This feature notifies you of new message arrival in any folder . A folder with new mail is identified by the unread icon.The icon is displayed as long as the folder is accessed .
In a collapsed folder tree , if a new message arrives in the parent folder , the folder name is displayed with a ' + ' plus sign beside the unread mail count . When a new message arrives in any child folders , the parent folder name turns bold .
D-Bus is a fast , lightweight message bus system that allows applications to communicate with each other . Select this option to generate a D-Bus message on the session bus whenever a new message arrives .
Select this option to display a new mail icon in the notification area when a new message arrives . You have two options to select from :
Select this option to make the new mail icon blink in the notification area on arrival of a new message .
Select this option to make the new message pop up along with the new mail icon .
Select this option to play a beep sound on the arrival of a new message .
Select this option to play a sound file of your choice on the arrival of a new message .
To specify the sound file you want to play :
Click None to open the Select Sound File browser window .
Browse to find the sound file of your choice .
Click Open to select the sound file .
Click Play to listen to the file .
Evolution provides a vertical view in addition to the classical view . In the vertical view , the message preview pane is located at the right side of the message list when compared to the classical view where the message preview pane is placed below the message list . Vertical view enables you to use the extra width of wide screen monitors .
To switch to vertical view , click View & gt ; Preview & gt ; Vertical View .
In vertical view , the message list contains double lines of compressed headers , which enables you to consume the extra width in the preview column . The compressed columns have Sender Name and Email , Attachment Icon , Date and Subject in the second line .
To switch to classical view , click View & gt ; Preview & gt ; Classical View .
Evolution compresses the TO , CC and BCC headers of received mail and shows only limited addresses . You can set the limit of the number of addresses to be displayed in the preview pane .
Use the following procedure to set the limit of addresses to be displayed :
Shrink To / CC / Bcc headers to column
Enter the limit in the field .
If you want to use Evolution and another email client , such as Mutt , at the same time , use the following procedure :
Download your mail in the other application as you would normally .
Select the account you want to use to share mail and click Edit . Instead of Edit , you might want to create a new account just for this source of mail by clicking New .
You can only use one mail client at a time . The mail files are locked by the mail program that is currently using them , so the mail files can 't be accessed by any other mail program .
If you get an email message with an attachment , Evolution can help you save the attachment or open it with the appropriate applications .
Evolution shows a right-arrow icon , the number of attachments , and a Save or Save All button to save all the attachments . Click the right-arrow icon to show the attachment bar .
Click the down-arrow on the attachment icon or right-click the attachment icon in the attachment bar .
Select a location and name for the file .
To open an attachment using another application :
Select the application to open the attachment .
The options available for an attachment vary depending on the type of attachment and the applications your system has installed . For example , attached word processor files can be opened in OpenOffice.org or another word processor , and compressed archive files can be opened in the File Roller application .
When someone sends you HTML mail that includes an image in the body of the message ( for example , the welcome message in your Inbox ) , Evolution displays the image inside the message . You can create messages like this by using the Insert Image tool in the message composer . Alternately , just drag an image into the message composition area .
Some images are links in a message , rather than being part of the message . Evolution can download those images from the Internet , but does not do so unless you request it . This is because remotely hosted images can be slow to load and display , and can even be used by spammers to track who reads the email . Not automatically loading images helps protect your privacy .
To load the images for one message , click View & gt ; Load Images .
To set the default action for loading images :
Select Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select Mail Preferences .
Select one of the items : Never Load Images Off the Net , Load Images in Mail From Contacts , or Always Load Images Off the Net .
When you create a newsgroup account , you are not subscribed to any groups . To subscribe to a newsgroup :
Click Folder & gt ; Subscriptions .
Select your NNTP account , select the groups you want to subscribe to , then click Subscribe .
Evolution allows you to delete unwanted messages . To delete a message , select it and press the Delete key , or click the Delete button in the toolbar , or press Ctrl + D , or right-click the message , then click Delete .
When you press Delete or click the Trash folder , your mail is not actually deleted , but is marked for deletion . Your email is recoverable until you have expunged your mail . When you expunge a folder , you remove all the mail that you have marked for deletion . To show deleted messages , uncheck Hide Deleted Messages option from the View menu . You can view the messages striken off for later deletion . You can also find deleted messages in your Trash folder .
To permanently erase all the deleted messages in a folder , click Folder & gt ; Expunge or press Ctrl + E.
Trash folders in GroupWise , local and IMAP accounts are actually virtual search folders that display all messages you have marked for later deletion . Hence , emptying Trash is nothing but expunging deleted mail from all your folders in the account .
You can undelete a message that has been deleted but not expunged . To undelete a message , select the message , click Edit & gt ; Undelete . Note that View & gt ; Hide Deleted messages in the menubar must be disabled for this .
If you have marked a message for deletion , undeleting it unmarks it , and the message is removed from the Trash folder .
You can start writing a new email message by clicking File & gt ; New & gt ; Mail Message , by pressing Ctrl + N when in the mail tool , or by clicking New in the toolbar .
Enter an address in the To field . If you want to enter multiple email addresses , type in the addresses separated by comma . You can also use a contact list to send messages to multiple recipients . Enter a subject in the Subject field , and a message in the box at the bottom of the window . After you have written your message , click Send .
For greater language display capabilities , click Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select the character set choices in the Mail Preferences and Composer Preferences sections . If you aren 't sure which one to use , select UTF-8 , which offers the greatest range of character displays for the greatest range of languages .
A character set is a computer 's version of an alphabet . In the past , the ASCII character set was used almost universally . However , it contains only 128 characters , meaning it is unable to display characters in Cyrillic , Kanjii , or other non-Latin alphabets . To work around language display problems , programmers developed a variety of methods , so many human languages now have their own specific character sets , and items written in other character sets display incorrectly . Eventually , standards organizations developed the UTF-8 Unicode * character set to provide a single compatible set of codes for everyone .
Most email messages state in advance which character set they use , so Evolution usually can display those messages correctly . However , if you find that messages are displayed as rows of incomprehensible characters , try selecting a different character set in the mail settings screen . If your recipients can 't read your messages , try selecting a different character set in the composer options dialog box . For some languages , such as Turkish or Korean , it might work best for you to select the language-specific character set . However , the best choice for most users is UTF-8 , which offers the widest range of characters for the widest range of languages .
To enable the Custom Header plugin :
Select Edit & gt ; Plugins .
Then select Custom Header . You can configure custom headers to set sensitivity and caveats to the outgoing messages .
In the Plugin Manager , select the Configuration tab to customize your header fields . You can add , edit , or remove the header fields . For every header field you add , you can specify the keys and values . The key is used as the title of the Custom Header . You can enter multiple values for the keys . You must use a semicolon to separate every value you enter .
Select New & gt ; Mail Message or Shift + Ctrl + M to open a Compose Message window .
Select Insert & gt ; Custom Header to open the Email Custom Header window .
In the Email Custom Header window , you can view all the header fields and values you add .
Set the values for the header fields by using the respective drop-down list .
Evolution normally sends mail as soon as you click Send . However , can save a message to be sent later :
If you are offline when you click Send , Evolution adds your message to the Outbox queue . The next time you connect to the Internet and send or receive mail , that message is sent .
Click File & gt ; Save Draft to store your messages in the Drafts folder for later revision .
If you prefer to save your message as a text file , click File & gt ; Save As , then specify a filename .
POP mail downloads all messages to your local system , but other connections usually download just the headers , and get the rest only when you want to read the message . Before you go offline , Evolution downloads the unread messages from the folders you have chosen to store .
To mark a folder for offline use ,
Right-click the folder , then click Properties .
Click Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation .
Your connection status is shown by the small icon in the lower left corner of the Evolution main window . When you are online , it displays two connected cables . When you go offline , the cables separate .
To cache your selected folders and disconnect from the network ,
Click File & gt ; Work Offline , or click the connection status icon in the lower left of the screen .
A message pops up and asks you whether you want to go offline immediately or synchronize folders locally before you go offline .
Click Synchronize to download all the messages to the folders marked for offline .
Click Do not synchronize to go offline immediately , without downloading the messages locally for offline operations .
Select Do not show this message again to switch off this popup . The default is to not synchronize while going offline .
When you want to reconnect , click File & gt ; Work Online , or click the connection status icon again .
This features prepares you for going offline and for offline operations . It helps you download all the messages locally before you go offline . If otherwise , by default , it goes offline when you click the offline button without downloading the message .
To download messages for offline operations , select File & gt ; Download messages for offline .
Evolution automatically understands the network state and acts accordingly . For instance , Evolution switches to offline mode when the network goes down and automatically switches on when the network is up again . Ensure that your system has Network Manager installed on to enable this feature .
You can also drag a file to the attachment bar of the composer window . If you want to send it as an inline attachment , right-click the attachment and click Properties , then select Automatic Display of Attachments .
When you send the message , a copy of the attached file goes with it . Be aware that large attachments can take a long time to send and receive .
Evolution has an Attachment Reminder plugin you can use to remind yourself to attach a file to an email . If it determines that you have not attached the file , it displays the following message :
Click Continue Editing to attach the missing file , or click Send to send the message without any attachment .
Select Edit & gt ; Plugins & gt ; Attachment Reminder .
Click Configuration , then make sure that Remind Missing Attachments is selected .
attach
To edit any of the existing keywords , select the keyword , click Edit , then modify the word as desired .
Addresses on the Bcc : list are hidden from the other recipients of the message . You can use it to send mail to large groups of people , especially if they don 't know each other or if privacy is a concern . If your Bcc : field is absent , click View & gt ; Bcc Field .
Evolution allows you to specify the Reply-To header in an email . To do this :
Open the Reply-To field by clicking View & gt ; Reply To .
Specify the address you want as the Reply-To address in the new Reply-To field .
Address auto-completion is enabled in Evolution by default when you create contacts . Evolution makes it easy for you to quickly fill in the address field without having to remember the email address of recipients . You can type nicknames or other portions of address data in the address field and Evolution will display a drop-down list of possible address completions from your contacts . If you type a name or nickname that can go with more than one card , Evolution opens a dialog box to ask you which person you meant .
If Evolution does not complete addresses automatically , click Edit & gt ; Preferences , then click Autocompletion . Then , select the address book you want to use for address autocompletion in the mailer .
Alternately , you can click the To : , Cc : , or Bcc : buttons to get a list of the email addresses in your contacts . Select addresses and click the arrows to move them into the appropriate address columns .

To reply to a message , select the message to reply to in the message list and click the Reply button in the toolbar , or right-click within the message and select Reply to Sender . This opens the message composer . The To : and Subject : fields are already filled , although you can alter them if you prefer . In addition , the full text of the old message is inserted into the new message , either in grey with a blue line on one side ( for HTML display ) or with the & gt ; character before each line ( in plain text mode ) , to indicate that it is part of the previous message .
If you 're reading a message with several recipients , you can use Reply to All instead of Reply . If there are large numbers of people in the Cc : or To : fields , this can save substantial amounts of time .
Susan sends an email to a client and sends copies to Tim and to an internal company mailing list of co-workers . If Tim wants to make a comment for all of them to read , he uses Reply to All , but if he just wants to tell Susan that he agrees with her , he uses Reply . His reply does not reach anyone that Susan put on her Bcc list , because that list is not shared with anyone .
If you subscribe to a mailing list , and want your reply to go just to the list rather than to the sender , select Reply to List instead of Reply or Reply to All .
The message composer makes several text searching features available to you .
Enter a word or phrase , and Evolution finds it in your message .
Select this item to repeat the last search you performed .
Find a word or phrase , and replace it with something else .
For all of these menu items , you can choose whether to search backwards in the document from the point where your cursor is . You can also determine whether the search is to be case sensitive in determining a match .
Some people do not have HTML-capable mail clients , or prefer not to receive HTML-enhanced mail because it is slower to download and display . Because of this , Evolution sends plain text unless you explicitly ask for HTML .
You can change the format of an email message from plain text to HTML by choosing Format & gt ; HTML from the menu bar .
HTML formatting tools are located in the toolbar just above the space where you actually compose the message . They also appear in the Insert and Format menus .
At the left edge of the toolbar , you can choose Normal for a default text style or Header 1 through Header 6 for varying sizes of header from large ( 1 ) to tiny ( 6 ) . Other styles include preformat , to use the HTML tag for preformatted blocks of text , and three types of bullet points for lists .
For instance , instead of using asterisks to mark a bulleted list , you can use the Bulleted List style from the style drop-down list . Evolution uses different bullet styles , and handles word wrap and multiple levels of indentation .
Use these buttons to determine the way your email looks . If you have text selected , the style applies to the selected text . If you do not have text selected , the style applies to whatever you type next .
Typewriter text , which is approximately the same as the Courier monospace font .
Located next to the text style buttons , the three paragraph icons should be familiar to users of most word processing software . The left-most button aligns your text to the left , the center button centers text , and the right button aligns the text to the right .
The button with the arrow pointing left decreases a paragraph 's indentation , and the right arrow increases its indentation .
At the far right is the color section tool , where a box displays the current text color . To choose a new color , click the arrow button to the right . If you have text selected , the color applies to the selected text . If you do not have text selected , the color applies to whatever you type next . You can select a background color or image by right-clicking the message background , then selecting Style & gt ; Page Style .
Under the Insert menu , there are several more items you can use to style your email . To use these and other HTML formatting tools , make sure you have enabled HTML mode by using Format & gt ; HTML from the menu bar .
Use the Insert a Link tool to put hyperlinks in your HTML messages . If you don 't want special link text , you can just enter the address directly , and Evolution recognizes it as a link .
Select the text you want to link from .
Right-click in the text , then click Insert Link .
Type the URL in the URL field .
Click Insert & gt ; Image in the menubar .
You can insert a horizontal line into the text to help divide two sections :
Click Insert & gt ; Rule in the menubar .
Select the width , size , and alignment .
You can insert a table into the text :
Click Insert & gt ; Table in the menubar .
Select the number of rows and columns .
Select the type of layout for the table .
To insert a picture for the background , click the filechooser button and select the desired image .
You can set the following options when sending mail in Evolution .
Evolution allows you to request a receipt for your sent messages to indicate when your message is being viewed by the recipient . Receipts are useful when sending email that is time-sensitive . To request a receipt , click Insert & gt ; Request Read Receipt in the composer window .
You can prioritize a message to be sent , so that the recipient sees its relative importance.To prioritize a message , click Insert & gt ; Prioritize Message in the composer window .
Evolution will ignore the message priority , because it assumes that the recipient should decide whether the message is important or not .
Evolution allows you to change the default settings . You can organize your Draft folder and Sent folder , set the addresses to which you want to sent carbon copies and blind carbon copies to . You can also change the settings for message receipts .
Select the mail account whose settings you want to change .
Click Edit to open the Account Editor .
Click the respective check boxes and enter the email addresses you want to always CC and BCC .
Select the desired option for send message receipts from the drop-down list .
By default , all the sent messages directly go to the Sent folder and those messages marked as drafts are saved in the Drafts folder . To change the default setting for draft items ,
Click the Drafts button to open the folder selection window .
Select the folder you want to save drafts to .
Click the Revert button to revert back to previous settings .
To change the default folder for sent items ,
Click the Sent button to open the folder selection window .
Select the desired folder for sent items .
Select an addressee as you would when sending a new message ; the subject is already entered , although you can alter it if you want .
Add your comments on the message in the composition frame
Attachments to a message you are forwarding are forwarded only when you send the original message as an attachment . Inline messages do not forward any attachments .
Don 't forward chain letters . If you must , watch out for hoaxes and urban legends , and make sure the message doesn 't have multiple layers of greater-than signs ( gt ; ) , indicating multiple layers of careless in-line forwarding .
WRITING IN CAPITAL LETTERS MEANS YOU 'RE SHOUTING ! Don 't write a whole message in capital letters . It hurts people 's ears .
Check your spelling and use complete sentences . By default , Evolution puts a red line beneath words it doesn 't recognize , as you type them .
Don 't send nasty emails ( flames ) . If you get one , don 't write back .
When you reply or forward , include enough of the previous message to provide context .
A message template is a standard message that you can use at any time to send mail with the same pattern . Evolution allows you to create and edit message templates .
To enable the Message Template Plugin :
Select Edit & gt ; Plugins , then select Templates .
Right-click & gt ; Move to folder / Copy to folder .
Select the Template local folder .
You can also edit an existing message and save it as a template .
Open the message and click Reply .
Edit the message body or the addresses according to your requirements .
Select File & gt ; Save as Template .
Click New and enter the information in the New Message window , according to your requirements .
Right-click the message you are replying to , then click Templates .
This option lists all the message templates in the Template folder .
Select Open the message template of your choice and make changes if required .
When you select a message template for replying , the subject of the reply is preserved .
In the Plugin Manager , select the Configuration tab to customize your message templates . You can add , edit or remove the key-value pairs . You can specify any number of key-value pairs .
In any template , the occurrence of every $ key is replaced by the value it has in the configuration . For example , if you set the key to Manager and the value to Harry , any occurrence of $ Manager is replaced by Harry in the message .
Assume that you have 1000 message templates with your current manager 's name has a reference in them . When the current manager is replaced by a new one , it 's not easy for you to manually replace the manager 's name in all the 1000 messages . If the messages have a $ Manager key value , you can reset the value in the Configuration tab of this plugin .
By default , the entire environment variables are used as a key-value pair . An occurrence of $ env _ variable is replaced by the value it carries . For example , an occurrence of $ PATH in your template is replaced by its value when the template is used .
The replacement process uses the following order of precedence :
$ key is replaced by the value set for it in the Configuration tab of the Templates plugin .
If the key is not found , it is then replaced with the value of its environment variable .
If key is neither a configuration option nor an environment variable , no changes are made .
If you create an event in the calendar component , you can then send invitations to the attendee list through the Evolution email tool . The invitation card is sent as an attachment in iCal format .
To send an invitation , right click on the calendar item and click Forward as iCalendar .
When you receive an invitation , you have several options :
Indicates you will attend the meeting . When you click the OK button , the meeting is entered into your calendar .
Indicates you will probably attend the meeting . When you click the OK button , the meeting is entered into your calendar , but is marked as tentative .
Indicates you are unable to attend the meeting . The meeting is not entered into your calendar when you click OK , although your response is sent to the meeting host if you have selected the Send reply to sender option .
Select this option if you want your response sent to the meeting organizers .
Because IMAP folders exist on the server , and opening them or checking them takes time , you need fine-grained control over the way that you use IMAP folders . You use the IMAP subscriptions manager to do this . If you prefer to have every mail folder displayed , you can select that option as well . However , if you want to choose specific items in your mailbox , and exclude others , you can use the subscription management tool to do that .
Select Folder & gt ; Subscriptions .
If you have accounts on multiple IMAP servers , select the server where you want to manage your subscriptions .
Evolution displays a list of available files and folders .
Select a file or folder by clicking it .
You should select at least the Inbox folder . Depending upon the way your IMAP server is configured , the list of available files might include non-mail folders . If it does , you can ignore them .
Enable the corresponding checkbox to add a folder to the subscribed list .
When you have subscribed to the folders you want , close the window .
To protect and encode your email transmissions , Evolution offers two encryption methods :
In order to send and receive encrypted emails using GPG , it is necessary to use two kinds of encryption keys : public and private . Public keys are used to encrypt messages and private keys to decrypt them . To send encrypted email , you must have the recepient 's public key , which is used to encrypt the message . The recipient then uses his / her private key to decrypt ( and read ) the encrypted message .
Those who wish to send you encrypted email must first have a copy of your public key on your keyring . To this end , public keys can be shared with those who want to send encrypted messages to you . In order to do this , you may place your public key on a public key server . Private keys should not be shared with others .
Evolution does not support older versions of PGP , such as OpenPGP and Inline PGP .
You can use encryption in two different ways :
You can encrypt the entire message , so that nobody but the recipient can read it .
You can attach an encrypted signature to a plain text message , so that the recipient can read the message without decrypting it , and needs decrypting only to verify the sender 's identity .
@ # $ 23ui7yr87 # @ ! 48970fsd .
Select an algorithm , then press Enter .
To accept the default algorithm of DSA and ElGamal , press Enter ( recommended ) .
Select a key length , then press Enter . To accept the default , 1024 bits , press Enter .
Enter how long your key should be valid for .
To accept the default of no expiration , press Enter , then press Y when you are prompted to verify the selection .
Type your real name , then press Enter .
Type your email address , then press Enter .
( Optional ) Type a comment , then press Enter .
Review your selected user ID . If it is correct , press O.
Type a passphrase , then press Enter .
Move your mouse randomly to generate the keys .
gpg --list-keys / home / you / .gnupg / pubring.gpg ---------------------------- pub 1024D / 32j38dk2 2001-06-20 you & lt ; you @ example.comgt ; sub 1024g / 289sklj3 2001-06-20 [ expires : 2002-11-14 ]
GPG creates one list , or keyring , for your public keys and one for your private keys . All the public keys you know are stored in the file ~ / .gnupg / pubring.gpg. If you want to give other people your key , send them that file .
If you want , you can upload your keys to a key server .
Key servers store your public keys for you so that your friends can decrypt your messages . If you choose not to use a key server , you can manually send your public key , include it in your signature file , or put it on your own Web page . However , it is easier to publish a key once , and then let people download it from a central place when they want .
If you don 't have a key to unlock or encrypt a message , you can set your encryption tool to look it up automatically . If it can 't find the key , an error message appears .
To send an encrypted message , you need to use the recipient 's public key in combination with your private key . Evolution handles the encryption , but you need to get the public key and add it to your keyring .
Select the account you want to use securely , then click Edit .
Specify your key ID in the PGP / GPG Key ID field .
Click Security & gt ; PGP Encrypt .
The Subject line of the message will not be encrypted and should not be used for sensitive information .
You can set Evolution to always sign your email messages :
Select Always Sign Outgoing Messages When Using This Account .
If you receive an encrypted message , you need to decrypt it before you read it . Remember , the sender must have your public key before they can send you an encrypted message .
When you view the message , Evolution prompts you for your PGP password . Enter it , and the unencrypted message is displayed .
S / MIME encryption also uses a key-based approach , but it has some significant advantages in convenience and security . S / MIME uses certificates , which are similar to keys . The public portion of each certificate is held by the sender of a message and by one of several certificate authorities , who are paid to guarantee the identity of the sender and the security of the message . Evolution already recognizes a large number of certificate authorities , so when you get a message with an S / MIME certificate , your system automatically receives the public portion of the certificate and decrypts or verifies the message .
S / MIME is used most often in corporate settings . In these cases , administrators supply certificates that they have purchased from a certificate authority . In some cases , an organization can act as its own certificate authority , with or without a guarantee from a dedicated authority such as VeriSign * or Thawte * . In either case , the system administrator provides you with a certificate file .
The certificate file is a password-protected file on your computer .
Select the file to import , then click Open .
Similarly , you can add certificates that are sent to you independently of any authority by clicking the Contact Certificates tab and using the same import tool . You can also add new certificate authorities , which have their own certificate files , in the same way .
After you have added your certificate , you can sign or encrypt a message by clicking Security & gt ; S / MIME Sign or S / MIME Encrypt in the message composer .
Select the account to encrypt the messages in .
Click Edit , then click Security .
Click Select next to Signing Certificate and specify the path to your signing certificate .
Click Select next to Encryption Certificate and specify the path to your encryption certificate .
Evolution allows you to import old email and contacts so that you don 't need to worry about losing your old information .
Evolution can import the following types of files :
The address book format used by the GNOME , KDE , and many other contact management applications . You should be able to export to vCard format from any address book application .
A format for storing calender files , which is generally used by Evolution , Microsoft Outlook , Sunbird , and Korganizer .
A format for storing calendar files. iCalendar is used by Palm OS handhelds , Evolution , and Microsoft Outlook .
Evolution / Mozilla / Outlook CSV / Tab ( .csv , .tab ) :
CSV or Tab files saved by using Evolution , Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla .
A file format used to store local copies of messages , calendar events , and other items within Microsoft software such as Microsoft Exchange Client , Windows Messaging , and Microsoft Outlook .
Berkley Mailbox ( .mbox or null extension ) :
The email format used by Mozilla , Netscape , Evolution , Eudora * , and many other email clients .
Click File & gt ; Import .
Select Import a Single File , then click Forward .
Browse and find the location to save the imported email , then click Forward .
Select the file to import , then click Forward .
Evolution automates the import process for several applications it can recognize .
Select Import Data and Settings From Older Programs , then click Forward .
Evolution searches for old mail programs and , if possible , imports the data from them .
While in Windows , import your .pst files into Mozilla Mail ( or another mail program such as Netscape or Eudora that uses the standard mbox format ) .
Copy the files to the system or partition that Evolution is installed on .
Use the Evolution import tool to import the files .
For POP mail , filters are applied as messages are downloaded . For IMAP mail , filters are applied to new messages when you open the Inbox folder . On Exchange servers , filters are not applied until you select your Inbox folder and click Message & gt ; Apply Filters , or press Ctrl + Y. To force your filters to act on all messages in the folder , select the entire folder by pressing Ctrl + A , then apply the filters by pressing Ctrl + Y.
Evolution helps you work by letting you sort your email . To sort by sender , subject , or date , click the bars with those labels at the top of the message list . The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates the direction of the sort . Click again , to sort them in reverse order . For example , click Date to sort messages by date from oldest to newest . Click again , and Evolution sorts the list from newest to oldest . You can also right-click the message header bars to get a set of sorting options , and to add to or remove columns from the message list .
To look at the complete headers for a message , click View & gt ; All Message Headers . To see all message data , click View & gt ; Message Source .
You can also choose a threaded message view . Click View & gt ; Group By Threads to turn the threaded view on or off . When you select this option , Evolution groups the replies to a message with the original , so you can follow the thread of a conversation from one message to the next .
In a thread of conversation view , each new message is stacked below of the ones that arrived before it , so that the newest message is always the one you see first . Whenever a new message arrives to an old thread as a reply , you will see it below the parent message . You always see the thread based on the date of the recent message received . The threads are sorted by the date of most recent message in the threads .
There is a GConf key to toggle between the collapsed or expanded state of mail thread . By default , it is collapsed and you can change this at / apps / evolution / mail / display / thread _ expand . If the value is set to false , expanded state is remembered . When you restart Evolution , all the threads are arranged to this state . This is a highly advanced option only for the advanced users .
The message list normally has columns to indicate whether a message has been read , whether it has attachments , how important it is , and the sender , date , and subject . You can change the column order , or add and remove columns by dragging and dropping them .
sender , location , to , from , size
To sort messages , perform the following procedure :
Right-click message header bar .
Click Sort by to get a list of options .
Sorts the message by different criteria as listed below :
Clicking each sort criteria cycles take you through three possibilities . Sort by criteria in ascending or descending order or unsort the message . When you click any of the sort criteria reiteratively , Evolution sorts the messages in a sequential order - ascending , descending and unsort . For example , when you click Recepients for the first time , Evolution sorts the messages by recipients in ascending order and for the second time , sorts in the reverse order . For the next click , messages will be displayed unsorted .
Sorts the messages top to bottom and returns you the sorted message list in the order of oldest to the latest .
Sort descending reverts the order and returns you the sorted message list in the order of newest to oldest .
Unsort removes sorting from this column , reverting to the order of messages as they were added to the folder .
Remove this column from the display . You can also remove columns by dragging the header off the list and letting it drop .
When you select this item , a dialog box appears , listing the possible columns . Drag the column you want into a space between existing column headers . A red arrow shows where the column will be placed .
Automatically adjusts the widths of the columns for the most efficient use of space .
Choose this item to pick a more complex sort order for messages , or to choose which columns of information about your messages you want to display .
Select the search criteria from the list .
You can view the messages in the desired order in the message list .
To make sure you don 't forget about a message , you can use the follow-up feature .
Right-click one of the messages .
You can also open the Flag to Follow Up window by
Selecting the Message menu .
Selecting Follow Up or pressing Shift + Ctrl + G.
A window opens to allow you to set the type of flag and the due date .
The flag itself is the action you want to remind yourself about . Several are provided for you , such as Call , Forward and Reply , but you can enter your own note or action if you want .
After you have added a flag , you can mark it as complete or remove it entirely by right-clicking the message , then click either Flag Completed or Clear Flag .
Overdue : Call by April 07 , 2003 , 5 : 00 PM .
Flags can help you organize your work in a number of ways . For example , you might add a Flag Status column to your message list and sort that way . Alternately , you could create a search folder that displays all your flagged messages , then clear the flags when you 're done , so the search folder contains only messages with upcoming deadlines .
If you prefer a simpler way to remind yourself about messages , you can mark them as important by right-clicking the message , then click Mark as Important or select Message & gt ; Mark as & gt ; Important from the menubar .
Evolution , like most other mail systems , stores mail in folders . You start out with a few mail folders , such as Inbox , Outbox , and Drafts , but you can create as many as you like . Create new folders by clicking Folder & gt ; New , or by right-clicking in the folder list and selecting New Folder .
When you click OK , your new folder appears in the folder view . You can then move the messages to it by dragging and dropping them , or right click on the message and choose Move to folder , or press Shift + Ctrl + V.
You can also drop the messages to a particular folder by selecting Message & gt ; Move to folder . This will open the Select folder window , where you can drop your message to any of the folders listed .
If you want to create a new folder click New at the bottom left of the window . Specify the location and enter the label of the folder in the entry box appeared at the top . You can also move the messages from one folder to another by selecting the message and then press the Move button at the bottom right .
If you create a filter with the filter assistant , you can have mail filed automatically . Select Edit & gt ; Message Filters to bring up the Message Filters window .
The Inbox folder on most IMAP servers cannot contain both subfolders and messages . When you create additional folders on your IMAP mail server , branch them from the root of the IMAP account 's folder tree , not from the Inbox . If you create subfolders in your Inbox folder , you lose the ability to read messages that exist in your Inbox until you move the folders out of the way .
Most email clients can search for messages for you , but Evolution does it differently and efficiently giving you faster search results with quick search , customized search and advanced search .
Quick Search displays all the messages that match the built-in criteria you selected from the drop-down list at the top left side , just above the message list .
Select the search criteria from the list :
Evolution displays the messages matching the criteria present in the shown message list
The following labels need not necessarily be the same as the default names listed here . You can change the name of these labels by selecting Edit & gt ; Preferences & gt ; Mail Preferences & gt ; Colors .
Evolution allows you to perform customized search . To search for a message :
Finds messages that contain the search text in the subject or sender . It does not search in the message body .
Finds messages with the search text in the To : and Cc : headers .
Searches the message body and all headers for the specified text .
Shows messages where the search text is in the subject line .
Finds messages whose From : header contains a match for your search text .
Searches only in message text , not any other header .
Click the drop-down list to select the scope
Type the search string in the search entry and press Enter .
The folder list will be disabled while you perform search on All Accounts or Current Account .
To clear your search you can click the Clear icon in the search string field , or choose Search & gt ; Clear from the menubar , or enter a blank search . You can also press Shift + Ctrl + Q to clear the search .
You can even perform a quick search on a customized search results as it just filters and displays the messages in the message list .
You can perform an advanced search based on any of the search types .
Select the Search menu .
Click Advanced Search to open the Advanced Search window .
Click Save to save your search results .
To save your search results other than from advanced search , select Search & gt ; Save Search . You can view the label of your search results listed under Search menu .
Select Search from the menu bar .
Click Edit Saved Searches to open the Searches window .
Click the Edit button to open the Edit Rule window .
You can also add or remove searches from the list by using the respective buttons available at the right .
Edit the title or search criteria from the dialog box .
Filters work very much like the mail room in a large company . Their purpose is to bundle , sort , and distribute mail to the various folders . In addition , you can have multiple filters performing multiple actions that might effect the same message in several ways . For example , your filters could put copies of one message into multiple folders , or keep one copy and send one to another person .
Type a name for the filter in the Rule name field .
Define the criteria for the filter in the first section .
For each of the filter criteria , you must first select which parts of the message you want to filter :
The sender 's email address or the name of the sender .
Searches in the actual text of the message .
( For programmers only ) Match a message according to an expression you write in the Scheme language used to define filters in Evolution .
Filters messages according to the date on which they were sent . First , choose the conditions you want a message to meet , such as before a given time or after a given time . Then choose the time . The filter compares the message 's time stamp to the system clock when the filter is run , or to a specific time and date you choose from a calendar . You can also have it look for a message within a range of time relative to the filter , such as two to four days ago .
This works the same way as the Date Sent option , except that it compares the time you received the message with the dates you specify .
Messages can have labels of Important , Work , Personal , To Do , or Later . You can set labels with other filters or manually .
Sets the message score to any whole number greater than 0 . You can have one filter set or change a message score , and then set up another filter to move the messages you have scored . A message score is not based on anything in particular : it is simply a number you can assign to messages so other filters can process them .
Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes .
Filters according to the status of a message . The status can be Replied To , Draft , Important , Read , or Junk .
Checks whether the message is flagged for follow-up .
Creates a filter based on whether there is an attachment for the email .
Filters based on the mailing list the message came from . This filter might miss messages from some list servers , because it checks for the X-BeenThere header , which is used to identify mailing lists or other redistributors of mail . Mail from list servers that do not set X-BeenThere properly are not be caught by these filters .
Filters messages according the server you got them from . This is most useful if you use multiple POP mail accounts .
Evolution can use an external command to process a message , then process it based on the return value . Commands used in this way must return an integer . This is most commonly used to add an external junk mail filter .
Filters based on the results of the junk mail test .
If you want multiple criteria for this filter , click Add and repeat step 4 .
Select the Actions for the Filter in the Then Section :
Moves the message into a folder you specify .
Puts a copy of the message into a folder you specify .
Marks the message for deletion . The message can be undeleted until you expunge or empty the trash .
Select this if you want to all other filters ignore this message . Note that only filters listed after this particular rule will be ignored .
Marks the message with a color of your choice .
Changes the numeric score by the amount you set .
Sets the status of the message . The status can be Replied To , Draft , Important , Read , or Junk .
If the message has a status value , unsets it . If a status value is not set , it does nothing .
Select a sound file for Evolution to play .
Sends the message to a program of your choice . No return value is expected . This feature can be used to create automatic Web postings from email messages or to perform additional message post processing not supported by Evolution .
Click Add if you need multiple actions and click OK .
There is an easy shortcut for fast filter or search folder creation :
Right-click the message in the message list .
Select one of the items under the Create Rule From Message submenu .
Creating a rule based on a message opens the filter creation tool with some of the information about the message already filled in for your convenience .
If you have several filters that match a single message , they are all applied to the message in order , unless one of the filters has the Stop Processing action . If you use that action in a filter , the messages that it affects are not touched by other filters .
When you first open the Filters window , you are shown the list of filters sorted in the order in which they will be applied . You can move them up and down in the priority list by clicking the Up and Down buttons .
Select the filter to edit , then click Edit .
Make the desired corrections , then click OK twice .
Select the filter to remove , then click Remove .
If filters aren 't flexible enough , or you find yourself performing the same search again and again , consider a search folder . Search folders are an advanced way of viewing your email messages within Evolution . If you get a lot of mail or often forget where you put messages , search folders can help you keep things organized .
A search folder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational tools : it looks like a folder , it acts like a search , and you set it up like a filter . In other words , a conventional folder actually contains messages , but a search folder is a view of messages that might be in several different folders . The messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of criteria you choose in advance .
As messages that meet the search folder criteria arrive or are deleted , Evolution automatically adjusts the search folder contents . When you delete a message , it is erased from the folder in which it actually exists , as well as any search folders that display it .
The Unmatched Search Folder is the opposite of other search folders : it displays all messages that do not appear in other search folders .
If you use remote email storage like IMAP or Microsoft Exchange , and have created search folders to search through them , the Unmatched Search Folder also searches the remote folders . If you do not create any search folders that search remote mail stores , the Unmatched Search Folder does not search in them either .
Click Message & gt ; Create Rule , then select a search folder based on Subject , Sender , Recipient , or Mailing List .
Select Search & gt ; Create Search Folder From Search .
Perform this operation from the search results . Create a search folder from search is enabled only when you already have performed a search .
Select Edit & gt ; Search Folder
Type the name of the search folder in the Search name field .
Select your search criteria . For each criterion , you must first select which of the following parts of the message you want the search to examine . The criteria are almost similar to those for filters .
Match a message according to an expression you write in the Scheme language used to define filters in Evolution .
Checks whether the message matchs all the criteria listed .
Select which folders will be used for the search folder . Your options are :
Uses all local folders for the search folder source in addition to individual folders that are selected .
Remote folders are considered active if you are connected to the server ; you must be connected to your mail server for the search folder to include any messages from that source in addition to individual folders that are selected .
Uses all local and active remote folders for the search folder source in addition to individual folders that are selected .
Uses individual folders for the search folder source .
click Add button to open the Select folder window .
Select the folder and press Add button .
You can view the folder added to the list in the entry box at the bottom of the New Search Folder window .
Evolution can check for junk mail for you . Evolution uses SpamAssassin and / or Bogofilter with trainable Bayesian filters to perform the spam check . When the software detects mail that appears to be junk mail , it will flag it and hide it from your view . Messages that are flagged as junk mail are displayed only in the Junk folder .
The junk mail filter can learn which kinds of mail are legitimate and which are not if you train it . When you first start using junk mail blocking , check the Junk folder to be sure that legitimate mail doesn 't get flagged as junk mail . If legitimate mail is incorrectly flagged , remove it from the Junk folder by right-clicking it and selecting Mark as Not Junk or pressing Shift + Ctrl + J. If Evolution misses junk mail , right-click the message , then click Mark as Junk or press Ctrl + J. When you correct it , the filter can recognize similar messages in the future , and becomes more accurate as time goes on .
Not junk Junk
To change your junk mail filtering preferences , click Edit & gt ; Preferences , then click Mail Preferences .
Send Me a Card : Adding New Cards Quickly
If you want to add or change cards , use the contact editor . You can edit email addresses , telephone numbers , mailing addresses and all other contact information you have entered for a particular contact .
Contains a more specific description of the person , including URLs for calendar and free / busy information .
You can also use the Forward Contact menu item in the Action menu , which opens a new message with the card already attached , or Send Message to Contact , which opens a new message to the contact 's email address .
You can add a card from within an email message or calendar appointment . In an open email , right-click any email address or message , and click Add to Address Book or select Add Sender to Address Book from the Message menu .
Most of the items in the contact editor simply display the information you enter , but some of them have additional features :
Mr. Her Excellency , Jr . Doe , John Q. de Icaza ,
Select one of your address books as the location for this contact . You might not be able to write to all available address books , especially those on a network .
Click the Personal Information tab to enter Web addresses for the contact . If the contact publishes free / busy or calendar data online , using a server other than Exchange or GroupWise , you can specify the addresses for those servers here . After you do so , you can check their schedules when creating appointments in the calendar .
Follow the steps given below to create a new card .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Contact .
Enter the contact information to the entry boxes provided .
If you want to change a card that already exists ,
Go to the Contacts window by selecting View & gt ; Window & gt ; Contacts from the menubar .
Double click on the card you want to edit .
Edit the information in the Contact Editor window .
You can also edit the contact information from the preview pane .
Right click on the address from Message Header .
Select Add to Address Book to bring up the Contact Quick-Add window .
Press the Edit Full button at the bottom left to bring up the Contact Editor window .
Evolution allows you to access your Google Address Book . You can view the Google contacts offline and create , modify and delete the contacts online .
To configure your Google Address Book in Evolution contacts :
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Address Book .
Select Google from the Type drop-down list .
Specify a name for the address book .
Select or deselect the following options and provide the username for the Google account :
Select this option to make the Google address book as your default address book .
Copy book content locally for offline operations :
Select this option to copy the address book to your machine so you can access the contacts even when you are not connected to the network .
Specify your username for your Google account .
Select Use SSL to enable a secure connection between Evolution and the server .
Set the time to automatically refresh the Google address book .
Evolution enables you to find the contact address quickly by using customized search . To find the contact address you are looking for , use the following procedure :
Specify the search criteria from any of the following :
Press Enter to begin the search .
For a more complex search , select Search Advanced and select criteria that describe your desired contact :
Name the rule in the Rule Name field .
Set up your criteria in the Find items field .
Select Add to add additional criteria .

To perform quick search , use the following procedure :
Evolution allows you to organize your contacts . You can create several individual address books , or contact lists . Within a given address book , you can have several categories of contacts .
Contact groups are nothing but address books . The simplest way to organize contacts is to create additional address books . You can create a new one by clicking File & gt ; New & gt ; Address Book . For contacts groups on your computer , you only need to provide a name . For contacts on the network , you need to provide more information about the contacts server you are trying to access .
To move a card from one group to another , just drag it from the main display of contacts and drop it to a different group . You cannot change the contents of most network contact groups .
Contacts groups are not the same as contact lists . A contact group is like a folder or address book full of contacts . A contact list is a single contact that contains other contacts , and is most often used to email several people at once .
You can import contacts from other contact management tools with the Import tool .
Mail yourself a contact as a vCard attachment .
Currently VCF and LDIF are supported . CSV and TAB format files are supported from Microsoft Outlook , Thunderbird , Mozilla , and Evolution .
A contact list is a set of contacts with a single nickname that you create . When you send email to the nickname , it is sent to every member of the list . This differs from a network mailing list in that it exists only on your computer as a convenience to you , rather than as an actual email address managed by a mailing list application on a server .
Open the list creation window by clicking the New List button .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Contact List .
Specify a name for the list .
Specify the names or email addresses of contacts .
Drag contacts from the main window into the list .
Choose whether you want to hide the email addresses when you send a message to the list .
When you are finished , click OK .
The list appears as a contact card , which you can use as you would any other card , including mailing the list to another person and sending email to the list .
To mail the list , open a new email and type the name you chose for the list . Evolution addresses the message to the entire list when you send the message . You can also right-click the list 's address card in the contacts tool and select Send Message to List .
Evolution cannot store contact lists on Microsoft Exchange servers .
To mark a card as belonging to a category ,
Double click the card to bring up the Contact Editor window
Select the category from the list . You can select as many or as few categories as you like .
If the master list of categories doesn 't suit you , you can add your own categories . To add a new category ,
Enter the new category in the entry box at the top .
You can view the category name in the field next to Categories button in the Contact Editor window .
You can edit or set the color and icon for each categories available under categories list . To achieve that click the Edit button at the bottom of the Categories window . Press the Delete button to delete the items from the list .
Network folders are only available when you are connected to the network . If you use a laptop or have a modem connection , you might want to copy or cache some of the network directory . You do this by dragging and dropping your desired contacts into the local address books .
You can also mark the network folder for offline usage . To mark the folder , right-click the folder , click Properties and select Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation .
To prevent excess network traffic , Evolution does not normally load data from the LDAP server upon opening .
Depending on your server settings , you might not be able to edit all the fields in a contact stored on an LDAP server . Some servers prohibit some or all changes , and others use a smaller set of fields than Evolution allows . Check with your system administrator if you need different settings .
In Evolution , you can keep multiple calendars and overlay them one over the next . For example , you might have a schedule of events for work , one for home , and one for your favorite sports team . The side bar lists those calendars , and you can select or deselect the boxes next to them to show and hide the appointments in your calendar view . By hiding and showing different sets of appointments , you can be sure to avoid conflicts , while keeping a minimum of clutter in your view .
Appointments for each calendar appear as a different color .
The toolbar offers you five different buttons that can show you different views of your calendar .
You can also select an arbitrary range of days in the small calendar in the side bar . To do this , select the days that you want to view in your calendar .
The Previous and Next buttons move you forward and back in your calendar pages . If you are using a week or month view , you can move by week or month . To return to today 's listing , click the Today button in the toolbar .
To visit calendar entries for a specific date , click Go To and select the date in the dialog box that appears .

Click Options & gt ; Recurrence , and specify whether you want the appointment to recur and how often .
An All Day event appears at the top of a day 's appointment list , in the header under the date , rather than inside . That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit inside each other . For example , a conference might be an All Day appointment , and the meetings at the conference could be timed appointments . Appointments with specific starting and ending times can also overlap . When they do they display as multiple columns in the day view of the calendar .
If you create calendar appointments that overlap , Evolution displays them side by side in your calendar .
You can have several Reminders for individual appointments , any time prior to the appointment you schedule . You can have one reminder of each of the following types :
A notification pops up on your screen to remind you of your appointment .
You can run a program as a reminder . You can enter its name in the text field , or find it with the Browse button .
Apart from the above notifications , the Evolution alarm icon blinks in the notification area . To pause the alarm or view the event , click the notification icon .
To create an alarm for this appointment , click Alarms on the toolbar , or click Options , then Alarms .
If you have stored reminders in a local calendar , they work from the moment you log in . However , for reminders stored on any remote server like GroupWise or Exchange which requires authentication , you must run Evolution at least once after logging in . No matter where the reminders are stored , you can quit Evolution and still be reminded of an upcoming appointment .
If you are using a Novell GroupWise or Microsoft Exchange server , other people on the server can check your schedule to see if you are available at any given time . If you have an appointment that is flexible or that you want to designate as Free rather than Busy time , select the Free box in the Show Time As section . Normally , appointments display as Busy .
You can categorize appointments in the same way you can categorize contacts .
Select the check box next to each category that matches the appointment you are creating .
You can add a new category to your category list by clicking Edit Master Category List , then click Click Here To Add A Category .
After you have selected your categories , click OK to assign these categories to the appointment . The categories you selected are now listed in the text box to the right of the Categories button .
Appointments with categories appear with icons in the calendar display , and you can also search for appointments by category . To display only the appointments in a particular category , select the corresponding category in the search bar at the top of the calendar .
Every two weeks on Monday and Friday until January 3 , 2008 Every month on the first Friday for 12 occurrences .
After you have finished settings , click the Save button in the toolbar to save and close the appointment editor window . If you want , you can alter an appointment summary in the calendar view by clicking it and typing . You can change other settings by right-clicking the appointment then choosing Open , or double-clicking the appointment .
A meeting is an event you schedule for multiple people . Evolution can be used to schedule group meetings and help you manage responses to meeting requests .
If you don 't need to collect attendance information when you 're scheduling an event , and would rather just announce the event , right-click the meeting and select Forward as iCalendar . This opens a new email message with the event notification attached as an announcement . Recipients can add the event to their calendars with one click , but it won 't automatically send you email about whether they plan to attend .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Meeting .
If you have multiple email accounts , select the one to use by selecting an item in the Organizer field .

To query free / busy information for the attendees , click the Free / Busy button on the toolbar .
Click Options & gt ; Free / Busy .
Click Save to save the meeting .
An email is sent out to all the recipients , inviting them to your event .
In Evolution , a meeting can have only one organizer , and only the organizer can add participants to that meeting . Though it is possible to change the organizer of a meeting , this is not recommended as a means to invite additional participants to meetings . If you want to invite additional people to a meeting and are not that meeting 's organizer , it is recommended that you forward the invitation message you received from the original meeting organiser to additional participants .
Meeting requests are sent as iCal attachments . To view or respond to one , click the attachment icon and view it inline in the mail window . All the details are shown about the event , including time and dates . Then you can choose how to reply to the invitation . Your choices are :
Click OK to send an email to the organizer with your answer . The event is also added to your calendar if you accept .
After you add the meeting to your calendar , you can make changes to the information , but if the original organizer sends out another update , your changes might be overwritten .
When you get a reply to a meeting invitation you sent , you can view it inline by clicking the attachment and selecting View Inline .
If you are in a hurry and you want to see the details of a meeting , mouse over the meeting in the calendar view . A tool tip appears with the details of the meeting . It will provide the agenda of the meeting , venue and time . If you are the organizer of the meeting , you can also view the status of the attendees , e.g. how many of them have accepted or declined the meeting request .
In addition to the standard meeting scheduling tools , you can use the Free / Busy view to check whether people are available in advance . The Free / Busy feature is normally a function of dedicated groupware servers such as Microsoft Exchange and Novell GroupWise . However , you can also publish Free / Busy information online , and access Free / Busy information published elsewhere . If not everyone you collaborate with publishes Free / Busy data , you can still use iCal event invitations to coordinate schedules with other people .
Click the Free / Busy button on the toolbar , or click Options & gt ; Free / Busy .
Adjust the meeting time , either by dragging the meeting borders or by using the Autopick buttons to choose a time automatically , then click Save and Close . Attendees on an Exchange server have the appointment updated automatically ; others receive email notification of any change in plans .
The Attendee List shows the people who have been invited to the appointment .
The Schedule Grid shows the published Free / Busy information for the people you have invited . This is where you compare schedules to find free time to schedule the appointment . Individuals have visible scheduling information only if they use the same Novell GroupWise or Microsoft Exchange server you do ( that is , if they are in the same organization as you ) , or if they publish free / busy information at a URL you can reach and you have entered that URL into their contact cards using the contact editor .
You can publish Calendar and Free / Busy information to a WebDAV , FTP server , or remote machine through secure shell or other Web server with HTTP PUT support . Check with your system administrator if you are not sure you have this functionality .
To set up Calendar or Free / Busy publishing :

Only attendees of a meeting can delegate a meeting .
In the Calendar , right-click the meeting you want to delegate .
Select the contacts you want to delegate the meeting to .
Each contact receives a copy of the meeting invitation .
To create a new calendar , click File & gt ; New & gt ; Calendar . If the calendar is one you plan to store locally , you need only provide a name and color . If it is a remote calendar , specify the name , color , URL , and a refresh frequency . The refresh frequency determines how often Evolution checks to see if the calendar has changed . If you are working with someone who publishes an online calendar , you might want to check for updates every thirty minutes . On the other hand , if you have displayed a sports team schedule in your calendar , you might not need to refresh it more than once a week .
Evolution lets you view and manage calendars on remote CalDAV servers . The procedure to create a CalDAV calendar source is similar to that of a remote Web calendar source . You can view and create calendar events on CalDav accounts just like other calendars on Evolution .

The Task List , located in the upper-right corner of the calendar , lets you keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments .
You can use the list in a larger window by clicking the Tasks button in the side bar .
Task Lists are more easily organized in the dedicated Tasks tool . Each task list is assigned a color , and you can use the Tasks tool switcher to hide and show task lists just like calendars . In the calendar display task pad , tasks from all visible task lists appear , color coded by list .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Task List .
Specify the name and color for the task list .
( Optional ) If the task is an online list , specify the URL of the task list .
After you have added a task to your to-do list , its summary appears in the Summary section of the task list . To view or edit a detailed description of an item , double-click it , or right-click it and select Open . You can delete items by selecting them , then clicking Delete .

If you share calendar files with friends or co-workers , you might need to configure your time zone .
Click the icon next to the Time Zone field , then select your location .
Each red dot represents a major city .
Select a city , then click OK .
You can also configure time zone information specific to each appointment . To do that , simply create a new appointment and click the globe to customize the time zone that the time exists in . For example , if you live in New York but have a telephone meeting set for noon with someone in California , you need to make sure that your schedules are coordinated . Setting time zones on a per-appointment basis helps avoid that potential confusion .
The Marcus Bains Line is a marker to show the current date and time . This feature is available in the Evolution calendar .

Allows you to save the vCards you receive in attachment to your Exchange address book . New Address Book entries can also be created on Exchange from received email messages with a single click .
After you have installed Evolution Exchange , you need to set up access for your Exchange account on both the Exchange server and within Evolution .
Configuring an Existing Account for Evolution Exchange Account
Check with your system administrator to ensure that :
You have a valid account on the Exchange server .
You are permitted to access the account with WebDAV . This is the default setting for the Exchange server , so unless your system administrator has specifically turned it off , no changes should be necessary .
When you know that your server is ready for you to connect , you are ready to add your Exchange account to Evolution Exchange .
Evolution Exchange comes with a simple account creation tool for Exchange accounts .
If you have no accounts configured , the simple account configuration assistant starts when you start Evolution . It asks only for the Outlook Web Access URL , and your username and password . Evolution Exchange determines the remaining information for you .
Only one Microsoft Exchange account can be configured in Evolution .
Use the following procedure to configure your existing account for Evolution Exchange :
Select the account you want to convert , then click Edit .
Click the Receiving Mail tab , then select Microsoft Exchange as your server type .
Type your user name , and the Outlook Web Access ( OWA ) URL . Click Authenticate , then enter the password at the prompt . The Exchange server authenticates your account .
Click the Receiving Options tab .
Specify how often to check for new mail , your Global Catalog server name and whether to apply filters to messages in your Inbox , check for junk , set a password expiry period , and any other settings you want to include .
Use the Defaults tab to define folders , send CC or BCC messages to certain email addresses , and set options for message receipts .
Use the Security tab to set PGP and S / MIME options .
Quit Evolution and restart it .
Changes to Evolution Exchange accounts configuration are not active until you have restarted the application .
When you have installed Evolution Exchange , you can access public folders and perform certain Exchange actions like delegation and password management , and subscribing to other user 's calendars , tasks , and contact folders . You can also carry out any folder-related operations like adding , deleting , and renaming folders , and selecting folder permissions on calendars , tasks , and contact folders . Use the regular Mail tool for mail , the Contacts tool for contacts , and the Calendar tool for setting schedules .
If you are using both an Exchange account and a local mail account , you should be aware that whenever you save an email address or appointment from an email message , it is saved in your Exchange contacts list or calendar , rather than in your local account . The same is true for synchronization with Palm OS devices ; tasks , and appointments . Addresses from your Palm OS device are synchronized in the Exchange folders rather than in local folders .
To avoid unnecessary strain on the server , the Global Address List ( GAL ) appears empty until you search for something in it .
Out of Office
You can set the priority and sensitivity of the sent message from an exchange account so that the recipients will know how important the message is . The priority can have one of the three options : High , Normal or Low ; and sensitivity can have one of the four options : Normal , Personal , Private and Confidential . You can also enable delivery receipt request and read receipt request for the messages sent .
Evolution lets you track the status of an item you have sent . You can enable the Delivery Receipt request as well as Read Receipt request so that you will know when the item reached the recipients or read by them .
To set the importance and sensitivity of the message :
Select the exchange account from the From field .
Click Insert & gt ; Send Options .
Select the priority for your sent message from the given three options ( Normal , High , Low ) .

You can send Meetings or Appointments on behalf of someone else if you have subscribed to his or her Calendar .
When the recipient receives the calendar item , a message indicates that the item was created by someone on behalf of the Delegator .
You can allow other people in your organization 's Global Address List to access your calendar , address book , and messages , and they can let you manage theirs . Delegation allows people to do anything from check on each other 's schedules to completely manage their personal information .

The delegate can view items in your folders , and can create new items , but cannot change any existing items .
Editor ( read , create , edit ) :
The delegate can view , create , and change items in your folders .
The delegate is notified through a separate mail that he or she is being added to your list of delegates . The mail summarizes all the rights that have been assigned to the delegate .
To access the folders delegated to you :

There are six items you can customize .
Previous versions of Evolution included directory servers , folder settings , and Exchange delegation in the settings tool . Directory servers can now be set up as contacts groups in the Contacts tool , you can change folder settings in the folder right-click menu , and Exchange delegation is available in the Message Menu of the Exchange tool .
Evolution allows you to maintain multiple accounts , or identities . When you are writing an email message , you can choose which account to use by selecting from the drop-down list next to the From field in the message composer .
Click Send / Receive to update all mail sources that are not disabled . If you don 't want to check mail for a given account , select the account in Edit & gt ; Preferences , then Mail Accounts page and click the Disable button .

To enable autocompletion , select each of the address books that you want to use auto completion in the Autocompletion page .
Evolution allows you to choose the headers that you want to download so that you can reduce the download time and filter or move your mail around the way you like it . Evolution helps you to customize your IMAP Mail header preferences and thus save the download time . The IMAP Mail header options are as follows :
All available IMAP mail headers for all the messages will be downloaded .
This will include Date , From , To , CC , Subject , Preferences , In-Reply-To , Message-ID , Mime-Version , and Content-Type . If you want to just fetch and see messages without having to categorically filter messages based on your mailing lists , choose this option . This will make Evolution work faster and is generally recommended for common users .
Enable this option to have filters based on mailing list headers ( like list ID ) so that in addition to the basic headers , the headers that correspond to mailing-lists are also fetched . Mailing list headers will have the informations such as the mailinglist-ID , owner of the mailing list , and so on with which you can create mailing list filters .
This is the default Header preference that comes with Evolution . When this option is chosen , Evolution will download a basic set of headers ( as described above ) along with a set of headers that are needed for client-side filters based on mailing lists . If you do not have any filters on Evolution , it is recommended to switch to the " Basic Headers Only " option .
On the Account Editor , click IMAP Headers tab to open IMAP Headers to the Account Editor .
Click Fetch All Headers to download all the available header information .
The more headers you have , the more time it will consume to download . This option is not recommended .
Click Basic Headers to download basic headers .
Click Basic and Mailing Headers to download both .
Click Add to add any predefined custom headers .
Click Remove to remove the custom headers .
The Mail Preferences tool lets you choose how to display citations , how long to wait before marking a message as read , and other mail display settings .
Normally , Evolution uses the same fonts as other GNOME applications . To choose different fonts , deselect Use the same fonts as other applications and select one font for standard typefaces and a second for monospace .
Fall back to threading message by subject Shrink To / CC / BCC header to Magic spacebar search folders
To group the messages as threads select View & gt ; Group By threads or press Ctrl + T.
Choose whether to delete messages automatically when quitting Evolution and how frequently , and whether you want to explicitly confirm the final deletion of messages . Select Confirm when expunging a folder to confirm the final deletion . You can have four different options to set the frequency for deletion : Everytime , Once per day , Once per week , and Once per month .
Evolution can alert you to the arrival of new mail with a beep or by playing a sound file . Choose your alert noise , or select none , as you prefer . You can choose not to notify on new mail arrival .
Turns image animation ( e.g. GIF files ) on or off .

Click the color tab and select a color , then click OK .
Select the label and click Edit .
Edit name and color , then click OK .
To assign a label to a specific email message :
Right-click the message from the message preview .
Click Label and select the desired label for the message .
The headers on an incoming message are the information about the message that isn 't the content of the message itself , such as the sender and the time it was sent . Select the options here to show or hide different amounts of information about the messages you read . You can also add or remove new mail headers to the list . The default mail headers cannot be removed .
This feature adds support for viewing the photograph of the sender at the right side of the preview pane .
To enable this feature , select Edit & gt ; Preferences & gt ; Mail Preferences & gt ; Headers & gt ; Show the photograph of sender in the email preview . Deselect this option to disable this feature .
Search for sender photograph only in the local address book
This feature is disabled by default as it causes delay in fetching the messages .
You can check your incoming messages for junk content by using Bogofilter and SpamAssassin * tools , which have trainable Bayesian filters . You need to enable the Junk plugins to start filtering junk mail .
Select the junk plugins you want . You can select either Bogofilter or SpamAssassin , or you can select both .
You can check incoming email for junk contents and also decide how often you want to delete junk mail . You also have the option to choose either SpamAssassin or Bogofilter , or you can select both .
This option turns automatic junk mail filtering on or off .
This option deletes junk messages when you exit . You can also specify when to delete the junk messages ( every time , once per day , once per week , once per month ) .
Select either SpamAssassin or Bogofilter , or both , as your junk filter . You can view them only if you have enabled the respective plugins . When you select any option , it also reports if the underlying binary is available or not .
Remote Test performs junk mail filtering on remote servers . It also includes online tests , like checking for blacklisted message senders and ISPs .
This option uses tests that require a network connection , such as checking to see if a message is in a list of known junk messages , or if the sender or gateway are blacklisted by anti-spam organizations . Online tests can make filtering slower , because remote tests add to the amount of time it takes to check for junk mail , but they increase accuracy . When you select this option , you do not need to do any additional setup .
Check new messages for junk contents option under Edit & gt ; Preferences & gt ; Mail Accounts & gt ; Edit & gt ; Receiving options is enabled only for IMAP . Check incoming mail for junk option under Edit & gt ; Preferences & gt ; Mail Preferences & gt ; Junk & gt ; General refers only to POP and Local Delivery .
There are two items in this section : Automatic Contacts automatically adds people that you respond to into your address book . You can select the default address book for automatic contacts from the list .
Instant Messaging Contacts periodically synchronizes contact information and images with your instant messaging program . Currently this only works with Pidgin . Your address book must not be a read-only one for both these features to function properly .
Allows you to delete messages after you have acted on an appointment . It also allows you to select calendars to search for meeting conflicts .
There are three tabs for message composer settings where you can set the composer preferences . The General tab covers assorted behavior , the Signature tab sets your signature , and the Spell Checking tab controls spell checking .
Choose how to normally forward and reply to messages , what character set they will use , whether they are in HTML , and whether that HTML can contain graphic emoticons .
You can forward messages either as an attachment or inline , or else as quoted . Choose reply style from the drop-down list : Quote original message , Do not quote original message , Attach original message .
When replying , you can choose where to place your signature in the message . You can place the signature either above the original message or at the end of the composer window . Top Posting is not recommended because placing the signature other than at the end of the message is against the mailing standards .
There are two optional alerts you can select :
Prompt When Sending Messages With an Empty Subject Line :
The composer warns you if you try to send a message without a subject .
Prompt When Sending Messages with Only Bcc Recipients Defined :
The composer warns you if you try to send a message that has only Bcc recipients . This is important because some mail servers fail to transmit blind carbon copy if you do not have at least one recipient that is visible to all readers .
The signature editor allows you to create several different signatures in plain text or in HTML , and to specify which of them will be added to email you create in the message composer . If you prefer to use an alternate signature or none at all , you can select it from the mail composer itself .
To choose a spell-checking language , select it here . You must install gnome-spell , aspell , and an aspell language package ( like for example aspell-en for english language ) for spell-checking to be available in Evolution . Additional dictionaries are available through your package manager and are detected automatically if you have installed them . To have the composer automatically check your spelling while you type , select Check Spelling While I Type . You can set the color for misspelled words .

This interface lets you configure your network proxy settings .
Select this option to connect directly to the internet .
The port for the machine defined by the Secure HTTP Proxy port field .
The port for the machine defined by the SOCKS host .
This key contains a list of hosts which are connected to directly , rather than via the proxy ( if it is active ) . The values can be hostnames , domains ( using an initial wildcard like * .example.com ) , IP host addresses ( both IPv4 and IPv6 ) and network addresses with a netmask similar to 192.168.0.0 / 24 .
If this option is enabled , it uses authentication to connect via the proxy server .
Username used to authenticate when performing an HTTP proxying .
Password used to authenticate when performing an HTTP proxying .

Specify whether your login is anonymous , uses an email address , or uses a distinguished name . If the login is not anonymous , specify the email address or distinguished name ( DN ) required by the server .
The Internet port Evolution connects to in order to access the LDAP database . This is normally 389 .
SSL and TLS are security mechanisms . If you select No Encryption , Evolution will send your password unencrypted . By using SSL or TLS , a secure connection will be used and your password will be sent encrypted .
Searches the Search Base and one entry below it .
Searches the Search Base and all entries below it .
The maximum time Evolution attempts to download data from the server before giving up .
The maximum number of results for a given search . Most servers refuse to send more than 500 , but you can set the number lower if you want to shorten downloads for very broad searches .
The name you want to use as a label for this folder . It can be any name you choose .
The search filter can be set here for all the LDAP queries . For example :
ObjectClass = * : Lists all the objects from the server.ObjectClass = User : Lists only the users . Filter ( | ( ObjectClass = User ) ( ObjectClass = groupOfNames ) ) : Retrieves the User and Contact List objects . ( amp ; ( mail = * ) ( ObjectClass = * ) ) : Lists the objects associated with the email addresses .
If you change any LDAP address book configurations , Evolution and the Evolution Data Server need to be restarted in order to see the changes .
If you are creating the address book for a specific account , type the name of the address book if you want the address book stored locally when offline , and if you want the address book to be your default folder .
Evolution allows you to view the error logs and set the display duration for the error messages that appear in the statusbar . When an error occurs , statusbar displays the error message for the specified time , then it is moved to the debug file .
From the Help menu , select Debug Logs .
Specify for how long error messages will be displayed in the statusbar .
If you haven 't used a handheld device with your computer before , you need to run the GNOME Control Center by clicking System & gt ; Settings , and make sure that Pilot Link is properly configured . Make sure that you have read and write permissions on the device , which is normally in / dev / pilot . If that does not work , check in / dev / ttyS0 if you have a serial connection , or in / dev / ttyUSB1 for a USB connection . You can do this by becoming root and adding your username to the group that owns this device node . For a USB device on sync , two device nodes are created , ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1 . The second node is the one to be used in configuring the device .
Click Enable , then click Settings to change what the conduit does when activated . Your options can vary depending on the conduit , but typically they are as follows :
Copy new data from the computer to the handheld , and from the handheld to the computer . Remove items that were on both systems but have been deleted on one .
If there is any new data on the handheld device , copy it to the computer .
Copy new data from the computer to the handheld .
Select the behavior you want for each conduit you choose to use . If you 're not sure , use Synchronize .
Use the following procedure to synchronize the data on your Palm OS device with the data you store in Evolution .
Put your handheld device in its cradle and press the HotSync button .
If you use Palm OS v. 4.0 and have password protection turned on for your handheld device , you might encounter trouble synchronizing . If this happens , try turning off password protection on your handheld , synchronize it with your desktop computer , and then re-enable password protection on your handheld .
If you have followed the setup instructions properly , your Palm OS device will synchronize data with Evolution .
Exchange and IMAP mail is stored on the server , so you do not need to migrate it to your Linux * partition . However , if you have stored mail on your computer , you might want to make it accessible to Evolution .
First , while using Windows , prepare your messages for import :
Clean up your mail . Delete messages and folders you do not need , and click File & gt ; Folders & gt ; Properties & gt ; Advanced & gt ; Compact to erase old , deleted messages from your PST file .
If you nest your folders one inside another , you might want to rename subfolders so that you can tell which folder they belong to . You must re-nest them after you load them into Evolution .
Import the files into Mozilla Mail ( or another mailer , such as Netscape or Eudora , that uses the standard mbox format ) .
Linux mailers cannot do this task , because it requires a library available only under Windows . In Mozilla , import by selecting Window Mail & Newsgroups Tools Import .
Windows \ \ Application _ Data \ \ Mozilla \ \ Profiles \ \ ( UserName ) \ \ ( Random Letters ) \ \ Mail \ \ Local Folders \ \ OutlookMail \ \
If you are using Windows Vista * , Windows XP * or Windows 2000 * , your Windows hard drive is probably in the NTFS format , which some Linux systems cannot read without additional software . You might find it simpler to copy the mail folders to a different drive or to burn a CD .

A tool that guides a user through a series of steps , usually to configure or set up a program . Equivalent to Wizard and Druid .
Any file sent with an email . Attachments can be embedded in a message or appended to it .
A feature which allows Evolution to quickly find and sort data .
Blind copy recipients ( Bcc ) receive a copy of an item . Other recipients receive no information about blind copies . Only the sender and the blind copy recipient know that a blind copy was sent . If a recipient replies and chooses Reply to All , the blind copy recipient does not receive the reply .
Carbon copy recipients ( CC ) receive a copy of an item . CC recipients are users who would benefit from the information in an item , but are not affected by or directly responsible for it . All recipients can see that a carbon copy was sent . They can also see the names of the CC recipients .
A small application that controls the transfer of data between a handheld device and a desktop computer .
To run a program . Any file that can be run is called an executable . Evolution can download executable attachments , but before they can be run , the files must be marked as executable with a shell or file manager . This security precaution prevents the automatic or accidental execution of malicious programs . For more information on executables and file permissions , see the documentation for your file manager or shell .
When messages are marked for deletion , they remain until they are expunged . When a message is expunged , it is permanently deleted , as long as it was marked for deletion .
Within Evolution , a filter is a method of sorting mail automatically when it is downloaded . You can create filters to perform one or more actions on a message that meets any ( or all ) of a wide range of criteria .
Forwards a copy of the message and any additional comments to a different email address .
A term describing an application that helps groups of people work together . Typically , a groupware application has several productivity features built into one program , including email , calendar , and address book tools .
Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML ) is a language for describing page layout in electronic documents such as Web pages , help files , and email messages . HTML can be used in email and news posts to insert images and apply text treatments .
iCal is a protocol that Evolution uses to manage the calendar section .
Internet Mail Access Protocol . It allows access to email that is typically stored remotely on a server rather than on a local hard disk . Often contrasted with POP .
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol . Allows a client to search through a large database of addresses , phone numbers , and people stored on a server .
The application with which a person reads and sends email . Its counterparts are the various types of mail servers , which handle user authentication and direct messages from the sender to the recipient .
Post Office Protocol . A mechanism for email transport . In contrast to IMAP , it is used only to get mail from a server and store it locally on your hard disk .
An agreed-upon method of communication , especially one for sending particular types of information between computer systems . Examples include POP ( Post Office Protocol ) , for email , and HTTP ( HyperText Transfer Protocol ) for Web pages .
A strong encryption method that uses a set of two keys , one of which is made public , and one of which is kept private . Data encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key . The longer the keys , the more difficult it is to break the encryption .
fly soup soap . fly in my soup fly in my soap . man grep
A program written in an interpreted ( rather than compiled ) language . Often used as a synonym for macro , to denote a series of prerecorded commands or actions within an application . Scripts are used to accomplish repetitive and tedious tasks , to save the user time .
LDAP can break contact lists into many groups . The search base tells LDAP the top group to use . How much of the Search Base to search is set by the Search Scope option .
An email organization tool . Search folders allow you to create a folder that contains the results of a complex search . Search folder contents are updated dynamically .
Search Scope states how much of the search base to search .
A program that sends mail . Evolution can use it instead of SMTP ; some people prefer it because it offers more flexibility ; however , it is more difficult to set up .
An area of Evolution that offers users fast access to the most frequently used features of the application .
Text placed at the end of every email sent , similar to a hand-written signature at the bottom of a written letter . A signature can be anything from a favorite quotation to a link to a Web page ; courtesy dictates that it be fewer than four lines long .
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol . The most common way of transporting mail messages from your computer to the server .
A small box of explanatory text that appears when the mouse pointer is held over a button or other interface element .
A program that inserts itself into other files or programs . When executed , it spreads to more programs and other computers . A virus can cause substantial damage by clogging networks or disk drives , deleting files , or opening security holes .
A file format for the exchange of contact information . When you get an address card attached to an email , it is probably in vCard format .

Importing Mail ( Optional ) Using Evolution : An Overview
Microsoft Outlook * and versions of Outlook Express after version 4 use proprietary formats that Evolution cannot read or import .
Before importing email from Netscape * , Mozilla and Netscape users need to click File & gt ; Compact & gt ; All Folders from within the Netscape or Mozilla mail tool . Otherwise , Evolution imports and undeletes the messages in your Trash folders .
Contacts files are stored in a database , but can be saved as a standard vCard * . To export an address book , click File & gt ; Save Address Book As VCard " . If you want to export only one contact , click File & gt ; Save Contact as VCard .
Now that the first-run configuration has finished , you 're ready to begin using Evolution . Here 's a quick explanation of what 's happening in your main Evolution window .
The folder list gives you a list of the available folders for each account . To see the contents of a folder , click the folder name and the contents are displayed in the message list .
The toolbar gives you fast and easy access to the frequently used features in each component .
The search tool lets you search your email , contacts , calendar , and tasks to easily find what you 're looking for .
The message list displays all the read and unread messages that you have . To view an email in the preview pane , click the message in the message list .
The switcher at the bottom of the side bar lets you switch between the Evolution tools - Mail , Contacts , Calendars , Memos and Tasks .
The status bar periodically displays a message , or tells you the progress of a task . This most often happens when you 're checking or sending email . These progress queues are shown in the previous figure . The Online / Offline indicator is here , too , in the lower left of the window .
The preview pane displays the message that is currently chosen in the message list .
The menu bar 's contents always provide all the possible actions for any given view of your data . If you 're looking at your Inbox , most of the menu items relate to email . Some content relates to other components of Evolution and some , especially in the File menu , relates to the application as a whole .
Anything related to a file or to the operations of the application is listed in this menu , such as creating things , saving them to disk , printing them , and quitting the program itself .
Holds useful tools that help you edit text and move it around . Also lets you access the settings and configuration options .
Lets you decide how Evolution should look . Some of the features control the appearance of Evolution as a whole , and others the way a particular kind of information appears .
Holds actions that can be performed on folders . You can find things like copy , rename , delete , and so on .
Holds actions that can be applied to a message . If there is only one target for the action , such as replying to a message , you can normally find it in the Message menu .
Lets you search for messages , or for phrases within a message . You can also see previous searches you have made . In addition to the Search menu , there is a text entry box in the toolbar that you can use to search for messages . You can also create a search folder from a search .
The Sidebar is the vertical panel on the left side of the Evolution main window . At the bottom of the Sidebar is the Switcher . This lets you switch between different Evolution tools like Mail , Memo , Tasks , and Contacts . Above the Switcher is a list of folders related to the current Evolution tool .
If you get large amounts of email , you might want more folders than just your Inbox . You can also create multiple calendar , task , or contacts folders .
Click Folder & gt ; New .
Type the name of the folder in the Folder Name field .
Select the location of the new folder .
Displays buttons with the label and the icon corresponding to it .
Displays buttons with the label , not the icons .
Shows buttons using the desktop toolbar settings .
This option hides all the shortcut buttons of switcher .
Right-click a folder or subfolder to display a menu with the following options :
Copies the folder to a different location . When you select this item , Evolution offers a choice of locations to copy the folder to .
Moves the folder to another location . When you select this item , Evolution offers a choice of locations to move the folder to .
Marks all the messages in the folder as read .
Lets you change the name of the folder .
Checks the number of total and unread messages in a folder , and , for remote folders , lets you select whether to copy the folder to your local system for offline operation .
You can also rearrange folders and messages by dragging and dropping them .
Any time new email arrives in a email folder , that folder label is displayed in bold text , along with the number of new messages in that folder .
Evolution email is like other email programs in several ways :
It can send and receive email in HTML or as plain text , and makes it easy to send and receive multiple file attachments .
It can sort and organize your email in a wide variety of ways with folders , searches , and filters .
It lets you guard your privacy with encryption .
junk email filtering searching search folder
If you find the preview pane too small , you can resize the pane , enlarge the whole window , or double-click the message in the message list to have it open in a new window . To change the size of a pane , drag the divider between the two panes .
As with folders , you can right-click messages in the message list and get a menu of possible actions , including moving or deleting them , creating filters or search folders based on them , and marking them as junk mail .
Most of the email-related actions you want to perform are listed in the Message menu and Folder menu in the menu bar . The most frequently used ones , like Reply and Forward , also appear as buttons in the toolbar . Most of them are also located in the right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts .
To begin using the calendar , click Calendar in the Switcher . By default , the calendar shows today 's schedule on a ruled background . At the left bottom , there is a monthly calendar you can use to switch days . At the upper right , there is a task list , where you can keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments . Below that , there is a memo list .
The appointment list displays all your scheduled appointments .
The month pane is a small view of a calendar month . To display additional months , drag the column border to the right . You can also select a range of days in the month pane to display a custom range of days in the appointment list .
Tasks are distinct from appointments because they generally don 't have times associated with them . You can use the list in a larger window by clicking the Tasks button in the side bar .
To use the contacts tool , click Contacts in the Switcher . By default , the display shows all your contacts in alphabetical order , in a minicard view . You can select other views from the View menu , and adjust the width of the columns by clicking and dragging the gray column dividers .
Another advantage of the Evolution contacts is its integration with the rest of the application . For example , you can right-click an email address in Evolution mail to instantly create a contact entry .
The largest section of the contacts display shows a list of individual contacts . You can also search the contacts in the same way that you search email folders , using the search tool on the right side of the toolbar .
With the Backup and Restore plugin enabled , you can successfully back up Evolution to your machine and restore it whenever it is required . The backup saves your Evolution settings , mail , contacts , tasks , memos , and calendars and creates an archive .
Select File & gt ; Backup Settings to select the folder where you want to save the backup .
The backup file to be created will be called evolution-backup.tar.gz.
Before the backup process starts a warning will be shown asking you to close Evolution .

Select the file and click Open .
Before the process starts , a pop-up window appears and asks you to close Evolution . Close all the windows and then click Restore in the pop-up window .
If you are creating your first account via the Startup Wizard , you can use the option to restore from the archive if it is available locally .
Evolution will auto-restart after the process .
If you are not already viewing mail , switch to the mail tool by clicking the Mail shortcut button , or press Ctrl + 1 . To read a message , select it in the message list ; if you 'd like to see it in its own window , either double-click it , press Enter , or press Ctrl + O.
To read mail with the keyboard , you can click the Spacebar to page down and press Backspace to page up while reading an email . Ensure that you use the keys when the message list is enabled .
Navigate the message list by using the arrow keys on the keyboard . To go to the next and previous unread messages , press the period ( . ) or comma ( , ) keys . On some keyboards , these keys are also marked with the & gt ; and & lt ; symbols , which is a convenient way to remember that they move you forward and backward in your message list . You can also use the right square bracket ( ] ) for the next unread message , and the left square bracket ( [ ) for the previous unread message .
With Magic Spacebar , you can easily read the unread messages in all the mail folders . You can read mail , scroll through mail and switch folders by using the Spacebar on your keyboard .
To enable Magic Spacebar :
Select Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select Mail Accounts .
Select the Enable Magic Spacebar check box .
When you are in the Mail view , the Spacebar has the following behavior :
When you press the Spacebar for the first time , it takes you to the next unread message .
If the message is more than one screen long , the Spacebar works as Page Down key .
If you press the Spacebar after you reach the bottom of the page , it takes you to the next unread message .
If there are no more unread messages in the mailbox , pressing the Spacebar takes you to the next unread message in the next folder .
If new messages arrive in a number of folders , the Spacebar toggles between those folders . This feature allows you to switch to the next unread message in a different folder without clicking the folder .
If this is your first time checking mail , or you haven 't asked Evolution to store your password , you are prompted for the password . Enter your password to download your email .
Evolution can notify you of new messages . When you receive a new message in your inbox , a blinking icon appears on the Switcher .
To enable this feature , select Edit & gt ; Plugins , then select the Mail Notification check box . You can configure the plugin by specifing the following in the Plugin Manager .
Select this option to restrict the mail notification to Inbox . With this option enabled , you are notified of each new message arrival in the Inbox .
This feature notifies you of new message arrival in any folder . A folder with new mail is identified by the unread icon.The icon is displayed as long as the folder is accessed .
In a collapsed folder tree , if a new message arrives in the parent folder , the folder name is displayed with a ' + ' plus sign beside the unread mail count . When a new message arrives in any child folders , the parent folder name turns bold .
D-Bus is a fast , lightweight message bus system that allows applications to communicate with each other . Select this option to generate a D-Bus message on the session bus whenever a new message arrives .
Select this option to display a new mail icon in the notification area when a new message arrives . You have two options to select from :
Select this option to make the new mail icon blink in the notification area on arrival of a new message .
Select this option to make the new message pop up along with the new mail icon .
Select this option to play a beep sound on the arrival of a new message .
Select this option to play a sound file of your choice on the arrival of a new message .
To specify the sound file you want to play :
Click None to open the Select Sound File browser window .
Browse to find the sound file of your choice .
Click Open to select the sound file .
Click Play to listen to the file .
Evolution provides a vertical view in addition to the classical view . In the vertical view , the message preview pane is located at the right side of the message list when compared to the classical view where the message preview pane is placed below the message list . Vertical view enables you to use the extra width of wide screen monitors .
To switch to vertical view , click View & gt ; Preview & gt ; Vertical View .
In vertical view , the message list contains double lines of compressed headers , which enables you to consume the extra width in the preview column . The compressed columns have Sender Name and Email , Attachment Icon , Date and Subject in the second line .
To switch to classical view , click View & gt ; Preview & gt ; Classical View .
Evolution compresses the TO , CC and BCC headers of received mail and shows only limited addresses . You can set the limit of the number of addresses to be displayed in the preview pane .
Use the following procedure to set the limit of addresses to be displayed :
Shrink To / CC / Bcc headers to column
Enter the limit in the field .
If you want to use Evolution and another email client , such as Mutt , at the same time , use the following procedure :
Download your mail in the other application as you would normally .
Select the account you want to use to share mail and click Edit . Instead of Edit , you might want to create a new account just for this source of mail by clicking New .
You can only use one mail client at a time . The mail files are locked by the mail program that is currently using them , so the mail files can 't be accessed by any other mail program .
If you get an email message with an attachment , Evolution can help you save the attachment or open it with the appropriate applications .
Evolution shows a right-arrow icon , the number of attachments , and a Save or Save All button to save all the attachments . Click the right-arrow icon to show the attachment bar .
Click the down-arrow on the attachment icon or right-click the attachment icon in the attachment bar .
Select a location and name for the file .
To open an attachment using another application :
Select the application to open the attachment .
The options available for an attachment vary depending on the type of attachment and the applications your system has installed . For example , attached word processor files can be opened in OpenOffice.org or another word processor , and compressed archive files can be opened in the File Roller application .
When someone sends you HTML mail that includes an image in the body of the message ( for example , the welcome message in your Inbox ) , Evolution displays the image inside the message . You can create messages like this by using the Insert Image tool in the message composer . Alternately , just drag an image into the message composition area .
Some images are links in a message , rather than being part of the message . Evolution can download those images from the Internet , but does not do so unless you request it . This is because remotely hosted images can be slow to load and display , and can even be used by spammers to track who reads the email . Not automatically loading images helps protect your privacy .
To load the images for one message , click View & gt ; Load Images .
To set the default action for loading images :
Select Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select Mail Preferences .
Select one of the items : Never Load Images Off the Net , Load Images in Mail From Contacts , or Always Load Images Off the Net .
When you create a newsgroup account , you are not subscribed to any groups . To subscribe to a newsgroup :
Click Folder & gt ; Subscriptions .
Select your NNTP account , select the groups you want to subscribe to , then click Subscribe .
Evolution allows you to delete unwanted messages . To delete a message , select it and press the Delete key , or click the Delete button in the toolbar , or press Ctrl + D , or right-click the message , then click Delete .
When you press Delete or click the Trash folder , your mail is not actually deleted , but is marked for deletion . Your email is recoverable until you have expunged your mail . When you expunge a folder , you remove all the mail that you have marked for deletion . To show deleted messages , uncheck Hide Deleted Messages option from the View menu . You can view the messages striken off for later deletion . You can also find deleted messages in your Trash folder .
To permanently erase all the deleted messages in a folder , click Folder & gt ; Expunge or press Ctrl + E.
Trash folders in GroupWise , local and IMAP accounts are actually virtual search folders that display all messages you have marked for later deletion . Hence , emptying Trash is nothing but expunging deleted mail from all your folders in the account .
You can undelete a message that has been deleted but not expunged . To undelete a message , select the message , click Edit & gt ; Undelete . Note that View & gt ; Hide Deleted messages in the menubar must be disabled for this .
If you have marked a message for deletion , undeleting it unmarks it , and the message is removed from the Trash folder .
You can start writing a new email message by clicking File & gt ; New & gt ; Mail Message , by pressing Ctrl + N when in the mail tool , or by clicking New in the toolbar .
Enter an address in the To field . If you want to enter multiple email addresses , type in the addresses separated by comma . You can also use a contact list to send messages to multiple recipients . Enter a subject in the Subject field , and a message in the box at the bottom of the window . After you have written your message , click Send .
For greater language display capabilities , click Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select the character set choices in the Mail Preferences and Composer Preferences sections . If you aren 't sure which one to use , select UTF-8 , which offers the greatest range of character displays for the greatest range of languages .
A character set is a computer 's version of an alphabet . In the past , the ASCII character set was used almost universally . However , it contains only 128 characters , meaning it is unable to display characters in Cyrillic , Kanjii , or other non-Latin alphabets . To work around language display problems , programmers developed a variety of methods , so many human languages now have their own specific character sets , and items written in other character sets display incorrectly . Eventually , standards organizations developed the UTF-8 Unicode * character set to provide a single compatible set of codes for everyone .
Most email messages state in advance which character set they use , so Evolution usually can display those messages correctly . However , if you find that messages are displayed as rows of incomprehensible characters , try selecting a different character set in the mail settings screen . If your recipients can 't read your messages , try selecting a different character set in the composer options dialog box . For some languages , such as Turkish or Korean , it might work best for you to select the language-specific character set . However , the best choice for most users is UTF-8 , which offers the widest range of characters for the widest range of languages .
To enable the Custom Header plugin :
Select Edit & gt ; Plugins .
Then select Custom Header . You can configure custom headers to set sensitivity and caveats to the outgoing messages .
In the Plugin Manager , select the Configuration tab to customize your header fields . You can add , edit , or remove the header fields . For every header field you add , you can specify the keys and values . The key is used as the title of the Custom Header . You can enter multiple values for the keys . You must use a semicolon to separate every value you enter .
Select New & gt ; Mail Message or Shift + Ctrl + M to open a Compose Message window .
Select Insert & gt ; Custom Header to open the Email Custom Header window .
In the Email Custom Header window , you can view all the header fields and values you add .
Set the values for the header fields by using the respective drop-down list .
Evolution normally sends mail as soon as you click Send . However , can save a message to be sent later :
If you are offline when you click Send , Evolution adds your message to the Outbox queue . The next time you connect to the Internet and send or receive mail , that message is sent .
Click File & gt ; Save Draft to store your messages in the Drafts folder for later revision .
If you prefer to save your message as a text file , click File & gt ; Save As , then specify a filename .
POP mail downloads all messages to your local system , but other connections usually download just the headers , and get the rest only when you want to read the message . Before you go offline , Evolution downloads the unread messages from the folders you have chosen to store .
To mark a folder for offline use ,
Right-click the folder , then click Properties .
Click Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation .
Your connection status is shown by the small icon in the lower left corner of the Evolution main window . When you are online , it displays two connected cables . When you go offline , the cables separate .
To cache your selected folders and disconnect from the network ,
Click File & gt ; Work Offline , or click the connection status icon in the lower left of the screen .
A message pops up and asks you whether you want to go offline immediately or synchronize folders locally before you go offline .
Click Synchronize to download all the messages to the folders marked for offline .
Click Do not synchronize to go offline immediately , without downloading the messages locally for offline operations .
Select Do not show this message again to switch off this popup . The default is to not synchronize while going offline .
When you want to reconnect , click File & gt ; Work Online , or click the connection status icon again .
This features prepares you for going offline and for offline operations . It helps you download all the messages locally before you go offline . If otherwise , by default , it goes offline when you click the offline button without downloading the message .
To download messages for offline operations , select File & gt ; Download messages for offline .
Evolution automatically understands the network state and acts accordingly . For instance , Evolution switches to offline mode when the network goes down and automatically switches on when the network is up again . Ensure that your system has Network Manager installed on to enable this feature .
You can also drag a file to the attachment bar of the composer window . If you want to send it as an inline attachment , right-click the attachment and click Properties , then select Automatic Display of Attachments .
When you send the message , a copy of the attached file goes with it . Be aware that large attachments can take a long time to send and receive .
Evolution has an Attachment Reminder plugin you can use to remind yourself to attach a file to an email . If it determines that you have not attached the file , it displays the following message :
Click Continue Editing to attach the missing file , or click Send to send the message without any attachment .
Select Edit & gt ; Plugins & gt ; Attachment Reminder .
Click Configuration , then make sure that Remind Missing Attachments is selected .

Addresses on the Bcc : list are hidden from the other recipients of the message . You can use it to send mail to large groups of people , especially if they don 't know each other or if privacy is a concern . If your Bcc : field is absent , click View & gt ; Bcc Field .
Evolution allows you to specify the Reply-To header in an email . To do this :
Open the Reply-To field by clicking View & gt ; Reply To .
Specify the address you want as the Reply-To address in the new Reply-To field .
Address auto-completion is enabled in Evolution by default when you create contacts . Evolution makes it easy for you to quickly fill in the address field without having to remember the email address of recipients . You can type nicknames or other portions of address data in the address field and Evolution will display a drop-down list of possible address completions from your contacts . If you type a name or nickname that can go with more than one card , Evolution opens a dialog box to ask you which person you meant .
If Evolution does not complete addresses automatically , click Edit & gt ; Preferences , then click Autocompletion . Then , select the address book you want to use for address autocompletion in the mailer .
Alternately , you can click the To : , Cc : , or Bcc : buttons to get a list of the email addresses in your contacts . Select addresses and click the arrows to move them into the appropriate address columns .
Send Me a Card : Adding New Cards Quickly Scheduling With the Evolution Calendar
To reply to a message , select the message to reply to in the message list and click the Reply button in the toolbar , or right-click within the message and select Reply to Sender . This opens the message composer . The To : and Subject : fields are already filled , although you can alter them if you prefer . In addition , the full text of the old message is inserted into the new message , either in grey with a blue line on one side ( for HTML display ) or with the & gt ; character before each line ( in plain text mode ) , to indicate that it is part of the previous message .
If you 're reading a message with several recipients , you can use Reply to All instead of Reply . If there are large numbers of people in the Cc : or To : fields , this can save substantial amounts of time .
Susan sends an email to a client and sends copies to Tim and to an internal company mailing list of co-workers . If Tim wants to make a comment for all of them to read , he uses Reply to All , but if he just wants to tell Susan that he agrees with her , he uses Reply . His reply does not reach anyone that Susan put on her Bcc list , because that list is not shared with anyone .
If you subscribe to a mailing list , and want your reply to go just to the list rather than to the sender , select Reply to List instead of Reply or Reply to All .
The message composer makes several text searching features available to you .
Enter a word or phrase , and Evolution finds it in your message .
Select this item to repeat the last search you performed .
Find a word or phrase , and replace it with something else .
For all of these menu items , you can choose whether to search backwards in the document from the point where your cursor is . You can also determine whether the search is to be case sensitive in determining a match .
Some people do not have HTML-capable mail clients , or prefer not to receive HTML-enhanced mail because it is slower to download and display . Because of this , Evolution sends plain text unless you explicitly ask for HTML .
You can change the format of an email message from plain text to HTML by choosing Format & gt ; HTML from the menu bar .
HTML formatting tools are located in the toolbar just above the space where you actually compose the message . They also appear in the Insert and Format menus .
At the left edge of the toolbar , you can choose Normal for a default text style or Header 1 through Header 6 for varying sizes of header from large ( 1 ) to tiny ( 6 ) . Other styles include preformat , to use the HTML tag for preformatted blocks of text , and three types of bullet points for lists .
For instance , instead of using asterisks to mark a bulleted list , you can use the Bulleted List style from the style drop-down list . Evolution uses different bullet styles , and handles word wrap and multiple levels of indentation .
Use these buttons to determine the way your email looks . If you have text selected , the style applies to the selected text . If you do not have text selected , the style applies to whatever you type next .
Typewriter text , which is approximately the same as the Courier monospace font .
Located next to the text style buttons , the three paragraph icons should be familiar to users of most word processing software . The left-most button aligns your text to the left , the center button centers text , and the right button aligns the text to the right .
The button with the arrow pointing left decreases a paragraph 's indentation , and the right arrow increases its indentation .
At the far right is the color section tool , where a box displays the current text color . To choose a new color , click the arrow button to the right . If you have text selected , the color applies to the selected text . If you do not have text selected , the color applies to whatever you type next . You can select a background color or image by right-clicking the message background , then selecting Style & gt ; Page Style .
Under the Insert menu , there are several more items you can use to style your email . To use these and other HTML formatting tools , make sure you have enabled HTML mode by using Format & gt ; HTML from the menu bar .
Use the Insert a Link tool to put hyperlinks in your HTML messages . If you don 't want special link text , you can just enter the address directly , and Evolution recognizes it as a link .

Evolution allows you to request a receipt for your sent messages to indicate when your message is being viewed by the recipient . Receipts are useful when sending email that is time-sensitive . To request a receipt , click Insert & gt ; Request Read Receipt in the composer window .
You can prioritize a message to be sent , so that the recipient sees its relative importance.To prioritize a message , click Insert & gt ; Prioritize Message in the composer window .
