Use shared address books on a local network .
The LDAP protocol was created to let users share contact information over a network by sharing access to a central directory . LDAP allows a company to maintain a shared set of contact information . Many companies keep a common LDAP address book for all their employees or for client contacts .
Enter the address of the server , the port number ( the default number is 389 ) and whether you want to connect securely .
Define the login method and your username .
Search Base : The search base is the starting point for a directory search . Contact your system administrator for information about the correct settings .
Search Scope : The search scope is the breadth of a given search . The following options are available :
One : Searches the Search Base and one entry below it .
Sub : Searches the Search Base and all entries below it .
Search Filter : The search filter can be set here for all the LDAP queries . For example :
( amp ; ( mail = * ) ( ObjectClass = * ) )
Download Limit : The maximum number of results for a given search . Most servers refuse to send more than 500 contacts , but you can set the number lower if you want to shorten downloads for very broad searches .
If you are unsure about some settings , ask your system administrator .
LDAP address books work like local address books on your computer , with the following exceptions :
Network folders are only available when you are connected to the network . If you use a laptop or have a modem connection , you might want to copy or cache some of the network directory . You do this by dragging and dropping your desired contacts into the local address books .
You can also mark the network folder for offline usage . To mark the folder , right-click the folder , click Properties and select Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation .

Using contact lists for grouping contacts .
A contact list is a set of contacts with a single nickname that you create . When you send mail to this nickname it is actually sent to every member of the list . This differs from a " real " mailing list in that it exists only on your computer as a convenience to you , rather than as an actual email address managed by a mailing list application on a server .
For example , you could create one contact for each family member , then add those contacts to a contact list called " Family " . Then , instead of entering each person 's email address individually , you can send emails to " Family " and the messages would go to all of them .
Choose whether you want to hide the email addresses when you send a message to the list .
Adding different types of address books and using more than one address book .
You can have multiple address books . For example , you might have one address book for work related contacts and one for private contacts . The side bar lists those address books , and you can select which address book is shown .
You can also use address books that are not on your computer , such as on the internet ( e.g. Google ) or in a local network ( e.g. LDAP ) .

Choose the destination ( e.g. the folder or calendar in Evolution ) for the imported data .
Repeat the import steps until you have imported all your data .
These steps refer to locally stored data such as POP accounts . For remote data ( like IMAP ) this is not necessary , since the data is still on the server and does not need to be manually transfered . You can set up the corresponding account in Evolution and the data will be downloaded .
First , while using Microsoft Windows , prepare your messages for import :
( Replace " username " by your username . )
Copy the Outlook files to the system or partition that Evolution is installed on .
As your Windows hard drive is probably in the NTFS format , some Linux systems cannot read it without additional software . You might find it simpler to copy the mail folders to a USB drive or to burn a CD .
Depending on your last step , either plug in the disk or USB drive with the data and wait until the file manager window opens , or mount your Windows drive .
Copy all the mail files into your home directory or another convenient place .
Choose the Outlook personal folders ( .pst ) file that you would like to import .
Choose the destination ( e.g. the folder in Evolution ) for the imported data .
To import single files ( mail , calendar data or contacts ) :
You can also import contacts that you have received as a vCard attachment of an email from its attachment menu .

Evolution can import the following types of files :
Berkeley Mailbox ( .mbox or no extension ) :
The email format used by Mozilla , Netscape , Evolution ( for local folders until version 2.32 ) , Eudora , and many other email clients .
Outlook Express 5 / 6 Personal Folders ( .dbx ) :
The email file format used by Microsoft Outlook Express 5 / 6 . For newer versions PST import is recommended .
A format for storing calendar files , which is generally used by Evolution , Microsoft Outlook , Sunbird , and Korganizer .
iCalendar or iCal ( .ics ) :
A format for storing calendar files. iCalendar is used by Evolution , Microsoft Outlook , Palm OS handhelds , and others .
vCard ( .vcf , .gcrd ) :
The address book format used by the GNOME , KDE , and many other contact management applications . You should be able to export to vCard format from any address book application .
Evolution / Mozilla / Outlook CSV / Tab ( .csv , .tab ) :
CSV ( Comma-separated values ) or Tabulator files saved by using Evolution , Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla .
Outlook Personal Folders ( .pst ) :
A file format used to store local copies of messages , calendar events , and other items within Microsoft software such as Microsoft Exchange Client , Windows Messaging , and Microsoft Outlook . It is also called " Personal Storage Table " .

Formatting emails ( in Plain Text and HTML )
The icons in the tool bar are explained in tooltips which appear when you hold your mouse pointer over the buttons .
Normally , you cannot set text color or size or embed pictures in messages . However , most newer email applications can do this by using HTML format , which is the format that also web pages use .

If you have a signature for your account defined but exceptionally do not want to use it for one message , or want to use a different signature , you can change it via the dropdown menu in the right upper corner in the email composer window .
A message template is a standard message that you can use at any time to send mail with the same pattern .
Use one of your templates for replying to a message
Select the message template of your choice . Make changes if required in the email composer window that will open .
When you select a message template for replying , the subject of the reply is preserved .
Store an existing or new message as a template
You can also edit an existing message and save it as a template :
Edit the message body or the addresses according to your requirements .
Configure variables in templates and reuse items from the message you reply to
You can add , edit or remove the key-value pairs . You can specify any number of key-value pairs .
In any template , the occurrence of every $ key is replaced by the value it has in the configuration . For example , if you set the key to Manager and the value to Harry , any occurrence of $ Manager is replaced by Harry in the message .
Assume that you have 1000 message templates with your current manager 's name in them . When the current manager is replaced by a new one , it is not easy for you to manually replace the manager 's name in all the 1000 messages . If the messages have a $ Manager key value , you can reset the value in the Configuration tab of this plugin .
By default , the entire environment variables are used as a key-value pair . An occurrence of $ env _ variable is replaced by the value it carries . For example , an occurrence of $ PATH in your template is replaced by its value when the template is used .
The replacement process uses the following order of precedence :
$ key is replaced by the value set for it in the Configuration tab of the Templates plugin .
If the key is not found , it is then replaced with the value of its environment variable .
If key is neither a configuration option nor an environment variable , no changes are made .
Using Elements From a Message in a Template When Replying
$ ORIG [ header _ name ] header _ name $ ORIG [ subject ] $ ORIG [ body ]
Change font alignment and paragraph formatting in the mail composer .
Located next to the Headers and Lists dropdown , the three paragraph icons should be familiar to users of most word processing software . The left-most button aligns your text to the left , the center button centers text , and the right button aligns the text to the right .
The button with the arrow pointing left decreases a paragraph 's indentation , and the right arrow increases its indentation .
Setting a priority for messages to be sent .
Evolution will ignore the message priority of incoming messages because the recipient should decide whether the message is important or not . You can set the " Important " flag for any messages .

When someone sends you HTML mail that includes an image in the body of the message ( for example , the welcome message in your Inbox ) , Evolution displays the image inside the message .
Some images are links in a message , rather than being part of the message . Evolution can download those images from the Internet , but does not do so unless you request it . This is because remotely hosted images can be slow to load and display , and can even be used by spammers to track who reads the email . Not automatically loading images helps protect your privacy .

If you want , you can upload your keys to a key server :
Key servers store your public keys for you so that your friends can decrypt your messages . If you choose not to use a key server , you can manually send your public key , include it in your signature file , or put it on your own Web page . However , it is easier to publish a key once , and then let people download it from a central place when they want .
If you don 't have a key to unlock or encrypt a message , you can set your encryption tool to look it up automatically . If it cannot find the key , an error message appears .
Decrypting and checking the signature of received GPG messages .
Receiving messages encrypted or signed via GPG
If you receive an encrypted message , you need to decrypt it before you can read it .
When you view the message , Evolution prompts you for your PGP password . Enter it , and the unencrypted message is displayed .
Senders must have your GPG public key before they can send you an encrypted message .
To send an encrypted message , you need to use the recipient 's public key in combination with your private key . Evolution handles the encryption , but you need to get the public key and add it to your keyring .

Available conditions for setting up filtering .
Filters messages according the server you got them from . This is most useful if you use multiple POP mail accounts .
Evolution can use an external command to process a message , then process it based on the return value . Commands used in this way must return an integer . This is most commonly used to add an external junk mail filter .
Applies an action always to any message , without further conditions . This could be useful at the end of the list of message filters to cover those emails that did not match any conditions for the preceding filters in the list .
Fix problems with mail filters that do not sort and organize mail as expected .
The order of filters is very important . They are applied to the original message in sequence , like a recipe .
When you move a message to another folder , " moving " actually means appending a copy of the message to the destination folder and marking the original message for deletion . So any subsequent filter rules will be applied to the original message that is now marked for deletion . Therefore moving a message should usually appear last in a sequence of filter rules .
Another thing you have to keep in mind is that filters depend on the " new " flag that is set on the server when a particular email message is initially fetched from the server . If you use another email client aside from Evolution , your filters may not work automatically .
If it is still unclear why filters do not work as expected , you can enable logging filter actions .
gsettings set org.gnome.evolution.mail filters-log-file " / home / myusername / my-filter-log " myusername my-filter-log ~ $ HOME
Use filter rules to sort your mail automatically into folders .
Message filters apply actions on messages based on conditions that you have defined . You can define filters for both incoming and outgoing emails .
Edit Preferences Mail Accounts Edit Receiving Options Options Apply filters to new messages in Inbox on this server
Define the conditions for the rule . For each condition , you first select which part of the message will be checked and then define the comparison .
The order of filters is important . Filters are applied to the original message in sequence , like a recipe .
Use folders to organize your mail .
Evolution , like most mail systems , uses folders to store email messages . You start out with a few mail folders such as the Inbox , Outbox , and Drafts . You can , however , create more folders if required .
Specify the name and the location of the folder .
The new folder will be shown in the folder view . You can then move messages into the folder .
The Inbox folders on most IMAP servers cannot contain both messages and subfolders . When creating additional folders on your IMAP mail server , branch the folders from the root of the IMAP account and not from the Inbox . Creating subfolders in your Inbox may prevent you from reading messages that exist in the Inbox . If this happens , move the folders to the IMAP account .
You can move messages into folders by using one of the following methods :
Drag and drop the messages into the folder .
The steps for copying are similar .
To make sure you do not forget about a message , you can use the follow-up feature .
Message Mark as Follow Up â€¦ Shift Ctrl G
A window opens to allow you to set the type of flag and the due date .
The flag itself is the action you want to remind yourself about , such as Call , Forward and Reply .
When you read a flagged message , its flag status is displayed at the top , before the message headers . An overdue message might tell you " Overdue : Call by April 07 , 2012 , 5 : 00 PM . "
Mark as Important Message Mark as Important

Possible reasons why emails are not sent .
There can be several reasons why emails are not sent :
Invalid email address . Check if all the addresses listed as mail recipients are correct . If the message contains a wrong or invalid email address , the message will not be sent .
Incorrect SMTP settings . Verify if the settings used for outgoing messages is correct . Using the incorrect server address or authentication method may prevent emails from being sent

This feature , when enabled , groups replies with the original email and allows you to follow the flow of the conversation from one message to the next .
When a new message arrives , it will be added below the parent message . Threads are sorted and displayed based on the date of the most recent message received .
The message list displays columns that indicate whether a message has been read , whether it has attachments , how important the message is , the sender , date , and the subject . To change the columns used in the message list , you can do one of the following :
Evolution allows you to sort your messages using these columns . Just click on the column label to sort the emails . The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates the direction of the sort .
Evolution provides other ways for sorting email messages . You can use Sort By , Sort Ascending , Sort Descending , or Unsort .

Work with your mail while not being connected to the network .
Forced offline mode helps you communicate with remote mail storage systems like GroupWise , IMAP or Exchange , in situations where you are not connected to the network at all times . Evolution keeps a local copy of one or more folders to allow you to compose messages , storing them in your Outbox to be sent the next time you connect .
Evolution 's forced offline mode only refers to mail and does not apply to contacts and calendars .
POP mail downloads all messages to your local system , but other connections usually download just the headers , and get the rest only when you want to read the message . Before you force Evolution to be offline , Evolution downloads the unread messages from the folders you have chosen to store .
To mark a mail folder for offline use ,
Copy folder content locally for offline operation
Evolution automatically understands the network state and acts accordingly . For instance , Evolution switches to offline mode when the network goes down and automatically switches on when the network is up again .

Tasks and memos from each task or memo list appear as different colors .
You can also use lists that are not on your computer , such as on the internet .
Lists of this type are read-only .
The list will be added in Evolution .
Using and managing categories for appointments , contacts , memos and tasks .
Another way to group contacts , appointments , tasks and memos ( summarized by the term " objects " in the following text ) is to mark them as belonging to different categories . You can mark an object as being in several categories or no category at all . For example in your address book , you put a friend in the " Business " category because he works with you and the " Friends " category because he is a friend .
To mark an object as belonging to a category ,
Double-click the object to bring up the corresponding editor .
Select the category from the list . You can select as many or as few categories as you like .
Double-click any object to bring up the corresponding editor .
Enter the new category in the entry box at the top .
The sender 's email address or the name of the sender .
Only the CC recipients of the message .
Only the BCC recipients of the message . Obviously this can only be applied to outgoing filters .
The sender 's email address or the name of the sender or the recipients of the message .
If a message uses a header more than once , Evolution pays attention only to the first instance , even if the message defines the header differently the second time . For example , if a message declares the Resent-From : header as " engineering @ example.com " and then restates it as " marketing @ example.com " , Evolution filters as though the second declaration did not occur . To filter on messages that use headers multiple times , use a regular expression .
Filters messages according to the date on which they were sent . First , choose the conditions you want a message to meet , such as before a given time or after a given time . Then choose the time . The filter compares the message 's time stamp to the system clock when the filter is run , or to a specific time and date you choose from a calendar . You can also have it look for a message within a range of time relative to the filter , such as two to four days ago .
This works the same way as the Date Sent option , except that it compares the time you received the message with the dates you specify .
Sets the message score to any whole number greater than 0 . You can have one filter set or change a message score , and then set up another filter to move the messages you have scored . A message score is not based on anything in particular : it is simply a number you can assign to messages so other filters can process them .
Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes .
Filters according to the status of a message . The status can be Replied To , Draft , Important , Read , or Junk .
Checks whether there is an attachment for the email .
Filters based on the mailing list the message came from . This filter might miss messages from some list servers , because it checks for the X-BeenThere header , which is used to identify mailing lists or other redistributors of mail . Mail from list servers that do not set X-BeenThere properly are not be caught by these filters .
Here you define your name and your email address .
Optionally you can make this account your default account ( e.g. when writing emails ) , set a Reply-To email address ( if you want replies to messages sent to a different address ) , and set an organization ( the company where you work , or the organization you represent when you send email from this account ) .
Select the condition from the dropdown list , and then type a search entry in the field .
If you search for something rather often , you will prefer not to type it many times . In this case you can use saved searches .
Edit the title or search conditions from the dialog box .
Enter a brief summary in the Summary field .
To synchronize with a Palm OS device like the PalmPilot ( TM ) and the Handspring Visor several steps are needed : First , you need to enable synchronization . Second , your computer needs to recognize and access your handheld . Third , you should decide what sort of synchronization behavior you want .
