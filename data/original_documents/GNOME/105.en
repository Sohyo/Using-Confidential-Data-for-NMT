You can test out a disc integrity after burning it .
Use an MD5 file to check the disk .
An MD5 ( Message-Digest Algorithm 5 ) is a cryptographic hash function widely used for checking data integrity .
If you choose this option , you will have to find the MD5 file by clicking in the folder icon placed below .
Erase a rewritable CD or DVD by blanking it .
You can prepare a rewritable disc , with existing data on it , for writing by blanking it .
If you have problems writing to a disc which you fast blanked , try disabling fast blanking and blank it again .
The disc may be ejected when the blanking is complete .
Split an audio project track into multiple tracks .
You can split a single audio track into multiple tracks when you put together an audio project .
Start an audio project and add the tracks you wish to use .
Select your preferred method of splitting the tracks :
This option allows you to select the exact length of each new section of the track manually .
Split track in parts with a fixed length
Use this method to split the track into multiple sections of equal length .
Split track in a fixed number of parts
This method allows you to split the track into a set number of sections , all of which will be of the same length .
If you try to split a track into a section less than six seconds long , the new section will be padded to make it 6 seconds long .
Write a video to a DVD or SVCD .
You can add a title for the disc in the text entry field below the project area .
Select the blank disc in the drop down list .
Save a project for editing or burning later .
Create the project and add the files you wish to use to the project .

Burn an existing disc image to a CD or DVD .
Disc images are archive files which contain all the data that is on a CD or DVD . Only one disc image can be on a CD at a time , but each archive can contain as little or as much data as you want , as long as it fits on the disc .
To burn a disc image to a CD or DVD , follow these steps :
Burn image Project New Project Burn image â€¦
Click here to select a disc image
If you are using a re-writable disc , which already contains data , you will be asked if you want to blank it or insert a different disc .
Create an identical copy of a disc .
Disc copy Project New Project Copy Disc ...
Choose whether you want to make a copy to another disc or create an image for later use .
If you are copying the disc and have only one disc drive , you will be asked to replace the disc you are copying with a writable one after the contents are copied temporarily to your hard disk .
Write data to a CD or DVD .
A data project is used for writing data ( for example , files , photos or music ) to a disc , without changing those files in any way . This can be useful for transferring files between computers .
If you are using a rewritable disc , which already contains data , you will be asked if you want to blank it or insert a different disc .
If you are using a rewritable disc and the data is not burned correctly onto it , you may need to do a full ( non-fast ) blank of the disc before trying again .
You can add a title for the CD in the text entry field below the project area .
Select the blank CD in the drop down list .
I cannot write to a DVD-R or a DVD-RW .
Some types of DVD-Rs and DVD-RWs are not compatible with all burners . Check the following to find out if those can be used with your burner .
Check if your DVD drive accepts DVD + or DVD- discs ; if it is labelled with " multi " , that usually indicates that it accepts both . Check your disc to see if it is the same as the DVD drive .
Check if your disc is dual layer or single layer : some DVD drives can not write to a dual layer disc .
If you are trying to use a DVD-R , check if it has already been written to before . If you are using a DVD-RW , try blanking it before you attempt to write to it .
My MP3s will not play in a DVD or CD player .
CD will not play in a CD player
If your CD is not playing in your CD player or stereo , it is probably because the music was not correctly written to the disc or because you used a data project to write the music to the CD instead of an audio project .
Many new CD and DVD players will play music CDs which were created using a data project , but most older players will not .
Older CD players might not be able to play CD-RWs .
If you are using a CD-RW , blank the CD .
Rewrite the CD as an audio project .
Burn audio CDs from digital audio files ( such as OGG , FLAC and MP3 )
