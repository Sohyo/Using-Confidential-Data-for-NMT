Importing Mail ( Optional ) Using Evolution : An Overview
Microsoft Outlook * and versions of Outlook Express after version 4 use proprietary formats that Evolution cannot read or import .
Before importing email from Netscape * , Mozilla and Netscape users need to click File & gt ; Compact & gt ; All Folders from within the Netscape or Mozilla mail tool . Otherwise , Evolution imports and undeletes the messages in your Trash folders .
Contacts files are stored in a database , but can be saved as a standard vCard * . To export an address book , click File & gt ; Save Address Book As VCard " . If you want to export only one contact , click File & gt ; Save Contact as VCard .
Now that the first-run configuration has finished , you 're ready to begin using Evolution . Here 's a quick explanation of what 's happening in your main Evolution window .
The folder list gives you a list of the available folders for each account . To see the contents of a folder , click the folder name and the contents are displayed in the message list .
The toolbar gives you fast and easy access to the frequently used features in each component .
The search tool lets you search your email , contacts , calendar , and tasks to easily find what you 're looking for .
The message list displays a list of email that you have received . To view an email in the preview pane , click the email in the message list .
The switcher at the bottom of the side bar lets you switch between the Evolution tools - Mail , Contacts , Calendars , Memos and Tasks .
The status bar periodically displays a message , or tells you the progress of a task . This most often happens when you 're checking or sending email . These progress queues are shown in the previous figure . The Online / Offline indicator is here , too , in the lower left of the window .
The preview pane displays the contents of the email that is selected in the message list .
The menu bar 's contents always provide all the possible actions for any given view of your data . If you 're looking at your Inbox , most of the menu items relate to email . Some content relates to other components of Evolution and some , especially in the File menu , relates to the application as a whole .
Anything related to a file or to the operations of the application is listed in this menu , such as creating things , saving them to disk , printing them , and quitting the program itself .
Holds useful tools that help you edit text and move it around . Also lets you access the settings and configuration options .
Lets you decide how Evolution should look . Some of the features control the appearance of Evolution as a whole , and others the way a particular kind of information appears .
Holds actions that can be performed on folders . You can find things like copy , rename , delete , and so on .
Holds actions that can be applied to a message . If there is only one target for the action , such as replying to a message , you can normally find it in the Message menu .
Lets you search for messages , or for phrases within a message . You can also see previous searches you have made . In addition to the Search menu , there is a text entry box in the toolbar that you can use to search for messages . You can also create a search folder from a search .
The Sidebar is the vertical panel on the left side of the Evolution main window . At the bottom of the Sidebar is the Switcher . This lets you switch between different Evolution tools like Mail , Memo , Tasks , and Contacts . Above the Switcher is a list of folders related to the current Evolution tool .
If you get large amounts of email , you might want more folders than just your Inbox . You can also create multiple calendar , task , or contacts folders .
Click Folder & gt ; New .
Type the name of the folder in the Folder Name field .
Select the location of the new folder .
Displays buttons with the label and the icon corresponding to it .
Displays buttons with the label , not the icons .
Shows buttons using the desktop toolbar settings .
This option hides all the shortcut buttons of switcher .
Right-click a folder or subfolder to display a menu with the following options :
Copies the folder to a different location . When you select this item , Evolution offers a choice of locations to copy the folder to .
Moves the folder to another location . When you select this item , Evolution offers a choice of locations to move the folder to .
Marks all the messages in the folder as read .
Creates another folder in the same location .
Deletes the folder and all its contents .
Checks the number of total and unread messages in a folder , and , for remote folders , lets you select whether to copy the folder to your local system for offline operation .
You can also rearrange folders and messages by dragging and dropping them .
Any time new email arrives in a email folder , that folder label is displayed in bold text , along with the number of new messages in that folder .
Evolution email is like other email programs in several ways :
It can send and receive email in HTML or as plain text , and makes it easy to send and receive multiple file attachments .
It can sort and organize your email in a wide variety of ways with folders , searches , and filters .
It lets you guard your privacy with encryption .
The message list displays all the messages that you have . This includes all your read and unread messages , and email that is flagged to be deleted .
The preview pane displays the message that is currently chosen in the message list .
If you find the preview pane too small , you can resize the pane , enlarge the whole window , or double-click the message in the message list to have it open in a new window . To change the size of a pane , drag the divider between the two panes .
As with folders , you can right-click messages in the message list and get a menu of possible actions , including moving or deleting them , creating filters or search folders based on them , and marking them as junk mail .
Most of the email-related actions you want to perform are listed in the Message menu and Folder menu in the menu bar . The most frequently used ones , like Reply and Forward , also appear as buttons in the toolbar . Most of them are also located in the right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts .
To begin using the calendar , click Calendar in the Switcher . By default , the calendar shows today 's schedule on a ruled background . At the left bottom , there is a monthly calendar you can use to switch days . At the upper right , there is a task list , where you can keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments . Below that , there is a memo list .
The appointment list displays all your scheduled appointments .
The month pane is a small view of a calendar month . To display additional months , drag the column border to the right . You can also select a range of days in the month pane to display a custom range of days in the appointment list .
Tasks are distinct from appointments because they generally don 't have times associated with them . You can use the list in a larger window by clicking the Tasks button in the side bar .
To use the contacts tool , click Contacts in the Switcher . By default , the display shows all your contacts in alphabetical order , in a minicard view . You can select other views from the View menu , and adjust the width of the columns by clicking and dragging the gray column dividers .
Another advantage of the Evolution contacts is its integration with the rest of the application . For example , you can right-click an email address in Evolution mail to instantly create a contact entry .
The largest section of the contacts display shows a list of individual contacts . You can also search the contacts in the same way that you search email folders , using the search tool on the right side of the toolbar .
With the Backup and Restore plugin enabled , you can successfully back up Evolution to your machine and restore it whenever it is required . The backup saves your Evolution settings , mail , contacts , tasks , memos , and calendars and creates an archive .
Select File & gt ; Backup Settings to select the folder where you want to save the backup .
Evolution is always backed up as evolution-backup.tar.gz.
Before the backup process starts , it asks you to close Evolution and displays a warning as shown below :
Select Restart Evolution after backup to restart Evolution immediately after the backup process .
Click Yes to close Evolution and start the backup .
Evolution will auto-restart after the process .
This feature restores your settings from the archive .
Select File & gt ; Restore Settings to open the available evolution-backup.tar.gz files .
Select the evolution-backup.tar.gz and click Save .
Before the process starts , a pop-up window appears and asks you to close Evolution . Close all the windows and then click Restore in the pop-up window .
If you are creating your first account via the Startup Wizard , you can use the option to restore from the archive if it is available locally .
Disables all the preview panes when you launch Evolution .
This prevents Evolution from opening the most recently selected message , task or contact , thus providing a way to avoid an application crash caused by previewing the message , task or contact .
Starts Evolution and begins composing a message to the email address listed .
Forces every part of Evolution to shut down immediately .
Makes Evolution your default email handler for your Web browser and in the GNOME * Control Center .
If you are not already viewing mail , switch to the mail tool by clicking the Mail shortcut button , or press Ctrl + 1 . To read a message , select it in the message list ; if you 'd like to see it in its own window , either double-click it , press Enter , or press Ctrl + O.
To read mail with the keyboard , you can click the Spacebar to page down and press Backspace to page up while reading an email . Ensure that you use the keys when the message list is enabled .
Navigate the message list by using the arrow keys on the keyboard . To go to the next and previous unread messages , press the period ( . ) or comma ( , ) keys . On some keyboards , these keys are also marked with the & gt ; and & lt ; symbols , which is a convenient way to remember that they move you forward and backward in your message list . You can also use the right square bracket ( ] ) for the next unread message , and the left square bracket ( [ ) for the previous unread message .
With Magic Spacebar , you can easily read the unread messages in all the mail folders . You can read mail , scroll through mail and switch folders by using the Spacebar on your keyboard .
Select Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select Mail Accounts .
Select the Enable Magic Spacebar check box .
When you are in the Mail view , the Spacebar has the following behavior :
When you press the Spacebar for the first time , it takes you to the next unread message .
If the message is more than one screen long , the Spacebar works as Page Down key .
If you press the Spacebar after you reach the bottom of the page , it takes you to the next unread message .
If there are no more unread messages in the mailbox , pressing the Spacebar takes you to the next unread message in the next folder .
If new messages arrive in a number of folders , the Spacebar toggles between those folders . This feature allows you to switch to the next unread message in a different folder without clicking the folder .
If this is your first time checking mail , or you haven 't asked Evolution to store your password , you are prompted for the password . Enter your password to download your email .
Evolution can notify you of new messages . When you receive a new message in your inbox , a blinking icon appears on the Switcher .
To enable this feature , select Edit & gt ; Plugins , then select the Mail Notification check box . You can configure the plugin by specifing the following in the Plugin Manager .
Notify new messages for Inbox only :
Select this option to restrict the mail notification to Inbox . With this option enabled , you are notified of each new message arrival in the Inbox .
This feature notifies you of new message arrival in any folder . A folder with new mail is identified by the unread icon.The icon is displayed as long as the folder is accessed .
In a collapsed folder tree , if a new message arrives in the parent folder , the folder name is displayed with a ' + ' plus sign beside the unread mail count . When a new message arrives in any child folders , the parent folder name turns bold .
D-Bus is a fast , lightweight message bus system that allows applications to communicate with each other . Select this option to generate a D-Bus message on the session bus whenever a new message arrives .
Select this option to display a new mail icon in the notification area when a new message arrives . You have two options to select from :
Select this option to make the new mail icon blink in the notification area on arrival of a new message .
Select this option to make the new message pop up along with the new mail icon .
Play sound when new messages arrive :
You have two options to select from :
Select this option to play a beep sound on the arrival of a new message .
Select this option to play a sound file of your choice on the arrival of a new message .
To specify the sound file you want to play :
Click None to open the Select Sound File browser window .
Click Open to select the sound file .
Click Play to listen to the file .
Evolution provides a vertical view in addition to the classical view . In the vertical view , the message preview pane is located at the right side of the message list when compared to the classical view where the message preview pane is placed below the message list . Vertical view enables you to use the extra width of wide screen monitors .
To switch to vertical view , click View & gt ; Preview & gt ; Vertical View .
In vertical view , the message list contains double lines of compressed headers , which enables you to consume the extra width in the preview column . The compressed columns have Sender Name and Email , Attachment Icon , Date and Subject in the second line .
To switch to classical view , click View & gt ; Preview & gt ; Classical View .
Evolution compresses the TO , CC and BCC headers of received mail and shows only limited addresses . You can set the limit of the number of addresses to be displayed in the preview pane .
Use the following procedure to set the limit of addresses to be displayed :
Select Edit & gt ; Preferences .
Shrink To / CC / Bcc headers to column
Enter the limit in the field .
If you want to use Evolution and another email client , such as Mutt , at the same time , use the following procedure :
Download your mail in the other application as you would normally .
Select the account you want to use to share mail and click Edit . Instead of Edit , you might want to create a new account just for this source of mail by clicking New .
You can only use one mail client at a time . The mail files are locked by the mail program that is currently using them , so the mail files can 't be accessed by any other mail program .
If you get an email message with an attachment , Evolution can help you save the attachment or open it with the appropriate applications .
Evolution shows a right-arrow icon , the number of attachments , and a Save or Save All button to save all the attachments . Click the right-arrow icon to show the attachment bar .
To save an attachment to disk :
Click the down-arrow on the attachment icon or right-click the attachment icon in the attachment bar .
Select a location and name for the file .
To open an attachment using another application :
Select the application to open the attachment .
The options available for an attachment vary depending on the type of attachment and the applications your system has installed . For example , attached word processor files can be opened in OpenOffice.org or another word processor , and compressed archive files can be opened in the File Roller application .
When someone sends you HTML mail that includes an image in the body of the message ( for example , the welcome message in your Inbox ) , Evolution displays the image inside the message . You can create messages like this by using the Insert Image tool in the message composer . Alternately , just drag an image into the message composition area .
Some images are links in a message , rather than being part of the message . Evolution can download those images from the Internet , but does not do so unless you request it . This is because remotely hosted images can be slow to load and display , and can even be used by spammers to track who reads the email . Not automatically loading images helps protect your privacy .
To load the images for one message , click View & gt ; Load Images .
To set the default action for loading images :
Select Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select Mail Preferences .
Select one of the items : Never Load Images Off the Net , Load Images in Mail From Contacts , or Always Load Images Off the Net .
When you create a newsgroup account , you are not subscribed to any groups . To subscribe to a newsgroup :
Click Folder & gt ; Subscriptions .
Select your NNTP account , select the groups you want to subscribe to , then click Subscribe .
Evolution allows you to delete unwanted messages . To delete a message , select it and press the Delete key , or click the Delete button in the toolbar , or press Ctrl + D , or right-click the message , then click Delete .
When you press Delete or click the Trash folder , your mail is not actually deleted , but is marked for deletion . Your email is recoverable until you have expunged your mail . When you expunge a folder , you remove all the mail that you have marked for deletion . To show deleted messages , uncheck Hide Deleted Messages option from the View menu . You can view the messages striken off for later deletion . You can also find deleted messages in your Trash folder .
To permanently erase all the deleted messages in a folder , click Folder & gt ; Expunge or press Ctrl + E.
Trash folders in GroupWise , local and IMAP accounts are actually virtual search folders that display all messages you have marked for later deletion . Hence , emptying Trash is nothing but expunging deleted mail from all your folders in the account .
You can undelete a message that has been deleted but not expunged . To undelete a message , select the message , click Edit & gt ; Undelete . Note that View & gt ; Hide Deleted messages in the menubar must be disabled for this .
If you have marked a message for deletion , undeleting it unmarks it , and the message is removed from the Trash folder .
You can start writing a new email message by clicking File & gt ; New & gt ; Mail Message , by pressing Ctrl + N when in the mail tool , or by clicking New in the toolbar .
Enter an address in the To field . If you want to enter multiple email addresses , type in the addresses separated by comma . You can also use a contact list to send messages to multiple recipients . Enter a subject in the Subject field , and a message in the box at the bottom of the window . After you have written your message , click Send .
This section contains the following topics :
For greater language display capabilities , click Edit & gt ; Preferences , then select the character set choices in the Mail Preferences and Composer Preferences sections . If you aren 't sure which one to use , select UTF-8 , which offers the greatest range of character displays for the greatest range of languages .
A character set is a computer 's version of an alphabet . In the past , the ASCII character set was used almost universally . However , it contains only 128 characters , meaning it is unable to display characters in Cyrillic , Kanjii , or other non-Latin alphabets . To work around language display problems , programmers developed a variety of methods , so many human languages now have their own specific character sets , and items written in other character sets display incorrectly . Eventually , standards organizations developed the UTF-8 Unicode * character set to provide a single compatible set of codes for everyone .
Most email messages state in advance which character set they use , so Evolution usually can display those messages correctly . However , if you find that messages are displayed as rows of incomprehensible characters , try selecting a different character set in the mail settings screen . If your recipients can 't read your messages , try selecting a different character set in the composer options dialog box . For some languages , such as Turkish or Korean , it might work best for you to select the language-specific character set . However , the best choice for most users is UTF-8 , which offers the widest range of characters for the widest range of languages .
To enable the Custom Header plugin :
Select Edit & gt ; Plugins .
Then select Custom Header . You can configure custom headers to set sensitivity and caveats to the outgoing messages .
In the Plugin Manager , select the Configuration tab to customize your header fields . You can add , edit , or remove the header fields . For every header field you add , you can specify the keys and values . The key is used as the title of the Custom Header . You can enter multiple values for the keys . You must use a semicolon to separate every value you enter .
Select New & gt ; Mail Message or Shift + Ctrl + M to open a Compose Message window .
Select Insert & gt ; Custom Header to open the Email Custom Header window .
In the Email Custom Header window , you can view all the header fields and values you add .
Set the values for the header fields by using the respective drop-down list .
Evolution normally sends mail as soon as you click Send . However , can save a message to be sent later :
If you are offline when you click Send , Evolution adds your message to the Outbox queue . The next time you connect to the Internet and send or receive mail , that message is sent .
Click File & gt ; Save Draft to store your messages in the Drafts folder for later revision .
If you prefer to save your message as a text file , click File & gt ; Save As , then specify a filename .
POP mail downloads all messages to your local system , but other connections usually download just the headers , and get the rest only when you want to read the message . Before you go offline , Evolution downloads the unread messages from the folders you have chosen to store .
To mark a folder for offline use ,
Right-click the folder , then click Properties .
Click Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation .
Your connection status is shown by the small icon in the lower left corner of the Evolution main window . When you are online , it displays two connected cables . When you go offline , the cables separate .
To cache your selected folders and disconnect from the network ,
Click File & gt ; Work Offline , or click the connection status icon in the lower left of the screen .
A message pops up and asks you whether you want to go offline immediately or synchronize folders locally before you go offline .
Click Synchronize to download all the messages to the folders marked for offline .
Click Do not synchronize to go offline immediately , without downloading the messages locally for offline operations .
Select Do not show this message again to switch off this popup . The default is to not synchronize while going offline .
When you want to reconnect , click File & gt ; Work Online , or click the connection status icon again .
This features prepares you for going offline and for offline operations . It helps you download all the messages locally before you go offline . If otherwise , by default , it goes offline when you click the offline button without downloading the message .
To download messages for offline operations , select File & gt ; Download messages for offline .
Evolution automatically understands the network state and acts accordingly . For instance , Evolution switches to offline mode when the network goes down and automatically switches on when the network is up again . Ensure that your system has Network Manager installed on to enable this feature .
To attach a file to your email :
Click the Attach button in the composer .
Select the file you want to attach .
You can also drag a file to the attachment bar of the composer window . If you want to send it as an inline attachment , right-click the attachment and click Properties , then select Automatic Display of Attachments .
When you send the message , a copy of the attached file goes with it . Be aware that large attachments can take a long time to send and receive .
Evolution has an Attachment Reminder plugin you can use to remind yourself to attach a file to an email . If it determines that you have not attached the file , it displays the following message :
Click Continue Editing to attach the missing file , or click Send to send the message without any attachment .
Select Edit & gt ; Plugins & gt ; Attachment Reminder .
Click Configuration , then make sure that Remind Missing Attachments is selected .
To edit any of the existing keywords , select the keyword , click Edit , then modify the word as desired .
Addresses on the Bcc : list are hidden from the other recipients of the message . You can use it to send mail to large groups of people , especially if they don 't know each other or if privacy is a concern . If your Bcc : field is absent , click View & gt ; Bcc Field .
Evolution allows you to specify the Reply-To header in an email . To do this :
Open the Reply-To field by clicking View & gt ; Reply To .
Specify the address you want as the Reply-To address in the new Reply-To field .
Address auto-completion is enabled in Evolution by default when you create contacts . Evolution makes it easy for you to quickly fill in the address field without having to remember the email address of recipients . You can type nicknames or other portions of address data in the address field and Evolution will display a drop-down list of possible address completions from your contacts . If you type a name or nickname that can go with more than one card , Evolution opens a dialog box to ask you which person you meant .
If Evolution does not complete addresses automatically , click Edit & gt ; Preferences , then click Autocompletion . Then , select the address book you want to use for address autocompletion in the mailer .
Alternately , you can click the To : , Cc : , or Bcc : buttons to get a list of the email addresses in your contacts . Select addresses and click the arrows to move them into the appropriate address columns .

To reply to a message , select the message to reply to in the message list and click the Reply button in the toolbar , or right-click within the message and select Reply to Sender . This opens the message composer . The To : and Subject : fields are already filled , although you can alter them if you prefer . In addition , the full text of the old message is inserted into the new message , either in grey with a blue line on one side ( for HTML display ) or with the & gt ; character before each line ( in plain text mode ) , to indicate that it is part of the previous message .
If you 're reading a message with several recipients , you can use Reply to All instead of Reply . If there are large numbers of people in the Cc : or To : fields , this can save substantial amounts of time .
Susan sends an email to a client and sends copies to Tim and to an internal company mailing list of co-workers . If Tim wants to make a comment for all of them to read , he uses Reply to All , but if he just wants to tell Susan that he agrees with her , he uses Reply . His reply does not reach anyone that Susan put on her Bcc list , because that list is not shared with anyone .
If you subscribe to a mailing list , and want your reply to go just to the list rather than to the sender , select Reply to List instead of Reply or Reply to All .
The message composer makes several text searching features available to you .
Enter a word or phrase , and Evolution finds it in your message .
Select this item to repeat the last search you performed .
Find a word or phrase , and replace it with something else .
For all of these menu items , you can choose whether to search backwards in the document from the point where your cursor is . You can also determine whether the search is to be case sensitive in determining a match .
Some people do not have HTML-capable mail clients , or prefer not to receive HTML-enhanced mail because it is slower to download and display . Because of this , Evolution sends plain text unless you explicitly ask for HTML .
You can change the format of an email message from plain text to HTML by choosing Format & gt ; HTML from the menu bar .
HTML formatting tools are located in the toolbar just above the space where you actually compose the message . They also appear in the Insert and Format menus .
At the left edge of the toolbar , you can choose Normal for a default text style or Header 1 through Header 6 for varying sizes of header from large ( 1 ) to tiny ( 6 ) . Other styles include preformat , to use the HTML tag for preformatted blocks of text , and three types of bullet points for lists .
For instance , instead of using asterisks to mark a bulleted list , you can use the Bulleted List style from the style drop-down list . Evolution uses different bullet styles , and handles word wrap and multiple levels of indentation .
Use these buttons to determine the way your email looks . If you have text selected , the style applies to the selected text . If you do not have text selected , the style applies to whatever you type next .
Typewriter text , which is approximately the same as the Courier monospace font .
Located next to the text style buttons , the three paragraph icons should be familiar to users of most word processing software . The left-most button aligns your text to the left , the center button centers text , and the right button aligns the text to the right .
The button with the arrow pointing left decreases a paragraph 's indentation , and the right arrow increases its indentation .
At the far right is the color section tool , where a box displays the current text color . To choose a new color , click the arrow button to the right . If you have text selected , the color applies to the selected text . If you do not have text selected , the color applies to whatever you type next . You can select a background color or image by right-clicking the message background , then selecting Style & gt ; Page Style .
Under the Insert menu , there are several more items you can use to style your email . To use these and other HTML formatting tools , make sure you have enabled HTML mode by using Format & gt ; HTML from the menu bar .
Use the Insert a Link tool to put hyperlinks in your HTML messages . If you don 't want special link text , you can just enter the address directly , and Evolution recognizes it as a link .
Select the text you want to link from .
Right-click in the text , then click Insert Link .
Type the URL in the URL field .
Click Insert & gt ; Image in the menubar .
Browse to and select the image file .
You can insert a horizontal line into the text to help divide two sections :
Click Insert & gt ; Rule in the menubar .
Select the width , size , and alignment .
You can insert a table into the text :
Click Insert & gt ; Table in the menubar .
Select the number of rows and columns .
Select the type of layout for the table .
Select a background for the table .
To insert a picture for the background , click the filechooser button and select the desired image .
You can set the following options when sending mail in Evolution .
Evolution allows you to request a receipt for your sent messages to indicate when your message is being viewed by the recipient . Receipts are useful when sending email that is time-sensitive . To request a receipt , click Insert & gt ; Request Read Receipt in the composer window .
You can prioritize a message to be sent , so that the recipient sees its relative importance.To prioritize a message , click Insert & gt ; Prioritize Message in the composer window .
Evolution will ignore the message priority , because it assumes that the recipient should decide whether the message is important or not .
Evolution allows you to change the default settings . You can organize your Draft folder and Sent folder , set the addresses to which you want to sent carbon copies and blind carbon copies to . You can also change the settings for message receipts .
Select the mail account whose settings you want to change .
Click Edit to open the Account Editor .
Click the respective check boxes and enter the email addresses you want to always CC and BCC .
Select the desired option for send message receipts from the drop-down list .
Changing Default Folder for Sent and Draft Items
By default , all the sent messages directly go to the Sent folder and those messages marked as drafts are saved in the Drafts folder . To change the default setting for draft items ,
Select the folder you want to save drafts to .
Click the Revert button to revert back to previous settings .
To change the default folder for sent items ,
Select the desired folder for sent items .
To forward a message you are reading :
Select an addressee as you would when sending a new message ; the subject is already entered , although you can alter it if you want .
Add your comments on the message in the composition frame
Attachments to a message you are forwarding are forwarded only when you send the original message as an attachment . Inline messages do not forward any attachments .
Don 't forward chain letters . If you must , watch out for hoaxes and urban legends , and make sure the message doesn 't have multiple layers of greater-than signs ( gt ; ) , indicating multiple layers of careless in-line forwarding .
WRITING IN CAPITAL LETTERS MEANS YOU 'RE SHOUTING ! Don 't write a whole message in capital letters . It hurts people 's ears .
Check your spelling and use complete sentences . By default , Evolution puts a red line beneath words it doesn 't recognize , as you type them .
Don 't send nasty emails ( flames ) . If you get one , don 't write back .
When you reply or forward , include enough of the previous message to provide context .
A message template is a standard message that you can use at any time to send mail with the same pattern . Evolution allows you to create and edit message templates .
Creating a Message Template from an Existing Message
To enable the Message Template Plugin :
Select Edit & gt ; Plugins , then select Templates .
Right-click & gt ; Move to folder / Copy to folder .
You can also edit an existing message and save it as a template .
Open the message and click Reply .
Edit the message body or the addresses according to your requirements .
Select File & gt ; Save as Template .
Click New and enter the information in the New Message window , according to your requirements .
Right-click the message you are replying to , then click Templates .
This option lists all the message templates in the Template folder .
Select Open the message template of your choice and make changes if required .
When you select a message template for replying , the subject of the reply is preserved .
In the Plugin Manager , select the Configuration tab to customize your message templates . You can add , edit or remove the key-value pairs . You can specify any number of key-value pairs .
In any template , the occurrence of every $ key is replaced by the value it has in the configuration . For example , if you set the key to Manager and the value to Harry , any occurrence of $ Manager is replaced by Harry in the message .
Assume that you have 1000 message templates with your current manager 's name has a reference in them . When the current manager is replaced by a new one , it 's not easy for you to manually replace the manager 's name in all the 1000 messages . If the messages have a $ Manager key value , you can reset the value in the Configuration tab of this plugin .
By default , the entire environment variables are used as a key-value pair . An occurrence of $ env _ variable is replaced by the value it carries . For example , an occurrence of $ PATH in your template is replaced by its value when the template is used .
The replacement process uses the following order of precedence :
$ key is replaced by the value set for it in the Configuration tab of the Templates plugin .
If the key is not found , it is then replaced with the value of its environment variable .
If key is neither a configuration option nor an environment variable , no changes are made .
If you create an event in the calendar component , you can then send invitations to the attendee list through the Evolution email tool . The invitation card is sent as an attachment in iCal format .
To send an invitation , right click on the calendar item and click Forward as iCalendar .
When you receive an invitation , you have several options :
Indicates you will attend the meeting . When you click the OK button , the meeting is entered into your calendar .
Indicates you will probably attend the meeting . When you click the OK button , the meeting is entered into your calendar , but is marked as tentative .
Indicates you are unable to attend the meeting . The meeting is not entered into your calendar when you click OK , although your response is sent to the meeting host if you have selected the Send reply to sender option .
Select this option if you want your response sent to the meeting organizers .
Because IMAP folders exist on the server , and opening them or checking them takes time , you need fine-grained control over the way that you use IMAP folders . You use the IMAP subscriptions manager to do this . If you prefer to have every mail folder displayed , you can select that option as well . However , if you want to choose specific items in your mailbox , and exclude others , you can use the subscription management tool to do that .
Select Folder & gt ; Subscriptions .
If you have accounts on multiple IMAP servers , select the server where you want to manage your subscriptions .
Evolution displays a list of available files and folders .
Select a file or folder by clicking it .
You should select at least the Inbox folder . Depending upon the way your IMAP server is configured , the list of available files might include non-mail folders . If it does , you can ignore them .
Enable the corresponding checkbox to add a folder to the subscribed list .
When you have subscribed to the folders you want , close the window .
To protect and encode your email transmissions , Evolution offers two encryption methods :
In order to send and receive encrypted emails using GPG , it is necessary to use two kinds of encryption keys : public and private . Public keys are used to encrypt messages and private keys to decrypt them . To send encrypted email , you must have the recepient 's public key , which is used to encrypt the message . The recipient then uses his / her private key to decrypt ( and read ) the encrypted message .
Those who wish to send you encrypted email must first have a copy of your public key on your keyring . To this end , public keys can be shared with those who want to send encrypted messages to you . In order to do this , you may place your public key on a public key server . Private keys should not be shared with others .
Evolution does not support older versions of PGP , such as OpenPGP and Inline PGP .
You can use encryption in two different ways :
You can encrypt the entire message , so that nobody but the recipient can read it .
You can attach an encrypted signature to a plain text message , so that the recipient can read the message without decrypting it , and needs decrypting only to verify the sender 's identity .
Select an algorithm , then press Enter .
To accept the default algorithm of DSA and ElGamal , press Enter ( recommended ) .
Select a key length , then press Enter . To accept the default , 1024 bits , press Enter .
Enter how long your key should be valid for .
To accept the default of no expiration , press Enter , then press Y when you are prompted to verify the selection .
Type your real name , then press Enter .
Type your email address , then press Enter .
( Optional ) Type a comment , then press Enter .
Review your selected user ID . If it is correct , press O.
Type a passphrase , then press Enter .
Move your mouse randomly to generate the keys .
gpg --list-keys / home / you / .gnupg / pubring.gpg ---------------------------- pub 1024D / 32j38dk2 2001-06-20 you & lt ; you @ example.comgt ; sub 1024g / 289sklj3 2001-06-20 [ expires : 2002-11-14 ]
GPG creates one list , or keyring , for your public keys and one for your private keys . All the public keys you know are stored in the file ~ / .gnupg / pubring.gpg. If you want to give other people your key , send them that file .
If you want , you can upload your keys to a key server .
Key servers store your public keys for you so that your friends can decrypt your messages . If you choose not to use a key server , you can manually send your public key , include it in your signature file , or put it on your own Web page . However , it is easier to publish a key once , and then let people download it from a central place when they want .
If you don 't have a key to unlock or encrypt a message , you can set your encryption tool to look it up automatically . If it can 't find the key , an error message appears .
To send an encrypted message , you need to use the recipient 's public key in combination with your private key . Evolution handles the encryption , but you need to get the public key and add it to your keyring .
Select the account you want to use securely , then click Edit .
Specify your key ID in the PGP / GPG Key ID field .
Click Security & gt ; PGP Encrypt .
The Subject line of the message will not be encrypted and should not be used for sensitive information .
You can set Evolution to always sign your email messages :
Select Always Sign Outgoing Messages When Using This Account .
If you receive an encrypted message , you need to decrypt it before you read it . Remember , the sender must have your public key before they can send you an encrypted message .
When you view the message , Evolution prompts you for your PGP password . Enter it , and the unencrypted message is displayed .
S / MIME encryption also uses a key-based approach , but it has some significant advantages in convenience and security . S / MIME uses certificates , which are similar to keys . The public portion of each certificate is held by the sender of a message and by one of several certificate authorities , who are paid to guarantee the identity of the sender and the security of the message . Evolution already recognizes a large number of certificate authorities , so when you get a message with an S / MIME certificate , your system automatically receives the public portion of the certificate and decrypts or verifies the message .
S / MIME is used most often in corporate settings . In these cases , administrators supply certificates that they have purchased from a certificate authority . In some cases , an organization can act as its own certificate authority , with or without a guarantee from a dedicated authority such as VeriSign * or Thawte * . In either case , the system administrator provides you with a certificate file .
The certificate file is a password-protected file on your computer .
Select the file to import , then click Open .
Similarly , you can add certificates that are sent to you independently of any authority by clicking the Contact Certificates tab and using the same import tool . You can also add new certificate authorities , which have their own certificate files , in the same way .
After you have added your certificate , you can sign or encrypt a message by clicking Security & gt ; S / MIME Sign or S / MIME Encrypt in the message composer .
To have every message signed or encrypted :
Select the account to encrypt the messages in .
Click Edit , then click Security .
Click Select next to Signing Certificate and specify the path to your signing certificate .
Click Select next to Encryption Certificate and specify the path to your encryption certificate .
Evolution allows you to import old email and contacts so that you don 't need to worry about losing your old information .
Evolution can import the following types of files :
vCard ( .vcf , .gcrd ) :
The address book format used by the GNOME , KDE , and many other contact management applications . You should be able to export to vCard format from any address book application .
A format for storing calender files , which is generally used by Evolution , Microsoft Outlook , Sunbird , and Korganizer .
iCalendar or iCal ( .ics ) :
A format for storing calendar files. iCalendar is used by Palm OS handhelds , Evolution , and Microsoft Outlook .
Evolution / Mozilla / Outlook CSV / Tab ( .csv , .tab ) :
CSV or Tab files saved by using Evolution , Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla .
Microsoft Outlook Express 4 ( .mbx ) :
A file format used to store local copies of messages , calendar events , and other items within Microsoft software such as Microsoft Exchange Client , Windows Messaging , and Microsoft Outlook .
LDAP Data Interchange Format ( .LDIF ) :
Berkley Mailbox ( .mbox or null extension ) :
The email format used by Mozilla , Netscape , Evolution , Eudora * , and many other email clients .
Click File & gt ; Import .
Select Import a Single File , then click Forward .
Browse and find the location to save the imported email , then click Forward .
Select the file to import , then click Forward .
Evolution automates the import process for several applications it can recognize .
Select Import Data and Settings From Older Programs , then click Forward .
Evolution searches for old mail programs and , if possible , imports the data from them .
While in Windows , import your .pst files into Mozilla Mail ( or another mail program such as Netscape or Eudora that uses the standard mbox format ) .
Copy the files to the system or partition that Evolution is installed on .
Use the Evolution import tool to import the files .
For POP mail , filters are applied as messages are downloaded . For IMAP mail , filters are applied to new messages when you open the Inbox folder . On Exchange servers , filters are not applied until you select your Inbox folder and click Message & gt ; Apply Filters , or press Ctrl + Y. To force your filters to act on all messages in the folder , select the entire folder by pressing Ctrl + A , then apply the filters by pressing Ctrl + Y.
Evolution helps you work by letting you sort your email . To sort by sender , subject , or date , click the bars with those labels at the top of the message list . The direction of the arrow next to the label indicates the direction of the sort . Click again , to sort them in reverse order . For example , click Date to sort messages by date from oldest to newest . Click again , and Evolution sorts the list from newest to oldest . You can also right-click the message header bars to get a set of sorting options , and to add to or remove columns from the message list .
To look at the complete headers for a message , click View & gt ; All Message Headers . To see all message data , click View & gt ; Message Source .
You can also choose a threaded message view . Click View & gt ; Group By Threads to turn the threaded view on or off . When you select this option , Evolution groups the replies to a message with the original , so you can follow the thread of a conversation from one message to the next .
In a thread of conversation view , each new message is stacked below of the ones that arrived before it , so that the newest message is always the one you see first . Whenever a new message arrives to an old thread as a reply , you will see it below the parent message . You always see the thread based on the date of the recent message received . The threads are sorted by the date of most recent message in the threads .
There is a GConf key to toggle between the collapsed or expanded state of mail thread . By default , it is collapsed and you can change this at / apps / evolution / mail / display / thread _ expand . If the value is set to false , expanded state is remembered . When you restart Evolution , all the threads are arranged to this state . This is a highly advanced option only for the advanced users .
The message list normally has columns to indicate whether a message has been read , whether it has attachments , how important it is , and the sender , date , and subject . You can change the column order , or add and remove columns by dragging and dropping them .
sender , location , to , from , size
To sort messages , perform the following procedure :
Click Sort by to get a list of options .
Sorts the message by different criteria as listed below :
Clicking each sort criteria cycles take you through three possibilities . Sort by criteria in ascending or descending order or unsort the message . When you click any of the sort criteria reiteratively , Evolution sorts the messages in a sequential order - ascending , descending and unsort . For example , when you click Recepients for the first time , Evolution sorts the messages by recipients in ascending order and for the second time , sorts in the reverse order . For the next click , messages will be displayed unsorted .
Sorts the messages top to bottom and returns you the sorted message list in the order of oldest to the latest .
Sort descending reverts the order and returns you the sorted message list in the order of newest to oldest .
Unsort removes sorting from this column , reverting to the order of messages as they were added to the folder .
Remove this column from the display . You can also remove columns by dragging the header off the list and letting it drop .
When you select this item , a dialog box appears , listing the possible columns . Drag the column you want into a space between existing column headers . A red arrow shows where the column will be placed .
Automatically adjusts the widths of the columns for the most efficient use of space .
Choose this item to pick a more complex sort order for messages , or to choose which columns of information about your messages you want to display .
Select the search criteria from the list .
You can view the messages in the desired order in the message list .
To make sure you don 't forget about a message , you can use the follow-up feature .
Selecting Follow Up or pressing Shift + Ctrl + G.
A window opens to allow you to set the type of flag and the due date .
The flag itself is the action you want to remind yourself about . Several are provided for you , such as Call , Forward and Reply , but you can enter your own note or action if you want .
After you have added a flag , you can mark it as complete or remove it entirely by right-clicking the message , then click either Flag Completed or Clear Flag .
Overdue : Call by April 07 , 2003 , 5 : 00 PM .
Flags can help you organize your work in a number of ways . For example , you might add a Flag Status column to your message list and sort that way . Alternately , you could create a search folder that displays all your flagged messages , then clear the flags when you 're done , so the search folder contains only messages with upcoming deadlines .
If you prefer a simpler way to remind yourself about messages , you can mark them as important by right-clicking the message , then click Mark as Important or select Message & gt ; Mark as & gt ; Important from the menubar .
Evolution , like most other mail systems , stores mail in folders . You start out with a few mail folders , such as Inbox , Outbox , and Drafts , but you can create as many as you like . Create new folders by clicking Folder & gt ; New , or by right-clicking in the folder list and selecting New Folder .
When you click OK , your new folder appears in the folder view . You can then move the messages to it by dragging and dropping them , or right click on the message and choose Move to folder , or press Shift + Ctrl + V.
You can also drop the messages to a particular folder by selecting Message & gt ; Move to folder . This will open the Select folder window , where you can drop your message to any of the folders listed .
If you want to create a new folder click New at the bottom left of the window . Specify the location and enter the label of the folder in the entry box appeared at the top . You can also move the messages from one folder to another by selecting the message and then press the Move button at the bottom right .
If you create a filter with the filter assistant , you can have mail filed automatically . Select Edit & gt ; Message Filters to bring up the Message Filters window .
The Inbox folder on most IMAP servers cannot contain both subfolders and messages . When you create additional folders on your IMAP mail server , branch them from the root of the IMAP account 's folder tree , not from the Inbox . If you create subfolders in your Inbox folder , you lose the ability to read messages that exist in your Inbox until you move the folders out of the way .
Most email clients can search for messages for you , but Evolution does it differently and efficiently giving you faster search results with quick search , customized search and advanced search .
Quick Search displays all the messages that match the built-in criteria you selected from the drop-down list at the top left side , just above the message list .
Select the search criteria from the list :
Evolution displays the messages matching the criteria present in the shown message list
The following labels need not necessarily be the same as the default names listed here . You can change the name of these labels by selecting Edit & gt ; Preferences & gt ; Mail Preferences & gt ; Colors .
Evolution allows you to perform customized search . To search for a message :
Finds messages that contain the search text in the subject or sender . It does not search in the message body .
Finds messages with the search text in the To : and Cc : headers .
Searches the message body and all headers for the specified text .
Shows messages where the search text is in the subject line .
Finds messages whose From : header contains a match for your search text .
Searches only in message text , not any other header .
Click the drop-down list to select the scope
Type the search string in the search entry and press Enter .
The folder list will be disabled while you perform search on All Accounts or Current Account .
To clear your search you can click the Clear icon in the search string field , or choose Search & gt ; Clear from the menubar , or enter a blank search . You can also press Shift + Ctrl + Q to clear the search .
You can even perform a quick search on a customized search results as it just filters and displays the messages in the message list .
You can perform an advanced search based on any of the search types .
Click Advanced Search to open the Advanced Search window .
Click Save to save your search results .
To save your search results other than from advanced search , select Search & gt ; Save Search . You can view the label of your search results listed under Search menu .
Select Search from the menu bar .
Click Edit Saved Searches to open the Searches window .
Click the Edit button to open the Edit Rule window .
You can also add or remove searches from the list by using the respective buttons available at the right .
Edit the title or search criteria from the dialog box .
Filters work very much like the mail room in a large company . Their purpose is to bundle , sort , and distribute mail to the various folders . In addition , you can have multiple filters performing multiple actions that might effect the same message in several ways . For example , your filters could put copies of one message into multiple folders , or keep one copy and send one to another person .
Click Edit & gt ; Message Filters .
Type a name for the filter in the Rule name field .
Define the criteria for the filter in the first section .
For each of the filter criteria , you must first select which parts of the message you want to filter :
The sender 's email address or the name of the sender .
( For programmers only ) Match a message according to an expression you write in the Scheme language used to define filters in Evolution .
Filters messages according to the date on which they were sent . First , choose the conditions you want a message to meet , such as before a given time or after a given time . Then choose the time . The filter compares the message 's time stamp to the system clock when the filter is run , or to a specific time and date you choose from a calendar . You can also have it look for a message within a range of time relative to the filter , such as two to four days ago .
This works the same way as the Date Sent option , except that it compares the time you received the message with the dates you specify .
Messages can have labels of Important , Work , Personal , To Do , or Later . You can set labels with other filters or manually .
Sets the message score to any whole number greater than 0 . You can have one filter set or change a message score , and then set up another filter to move the messages you have scored . A message score is not based on anything in particular : it is simply a number you can assign to messages so other filters can process them .
Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes .
Filters according to the status of a message . The status can be Replied To , Draft , Important , Read , or Junk .
Checks whether the message is flagged for follow-up .
Creates a filter based on whether there is an attachment for the email .
Filters based on the mailing list the message came from . This filter might miss messages from some list servers , because it checks for the X-BeenThere header , which is used to identify mailing lists or other redistributors of mail . Mail from list servers that do not set X-BeenThere properly are not be caught by these filters .
Filters messages according the server you got them from . This is most useful if you use multiple POP mail accounts .
Evolution can use an external command to process a message , then process it based on the return value . Commands used in this way must return an integer . This is most commonly used to add an external junk mail filter .
Filters based on the results of the junk mail test .
Select the Criteria for the Condition :
If you want multiple criteria for this filter , click Add and repeat step 4 .
Select the Actions for the Filter in the Then Section :
Select any of the following options .
Moves the message into a folder you specify .
Puts a copy of the message into a folder you specify .
Marks the message for deletion . The message can be undeleted until you expunge or empty the trash .
Select this if you want to all other filters ignore this message . Note that only filters listed after this particular rule will be ignored .
Marks the message with a color of your choice .
Assigns the message a numeric score .
Changes the numeric score by the amount you set .
Sets the status of the message . The status can be Replied To , Draft , Important , Read , or Junk .
If the message has a status value , unsets it . If a status value is not set , it does nothing .
Select a sound file for Evolution to play .
Sends the message to a program of your choice . No return value is expected . This feature can be used to create automatic Web postings from email messages or to perform additional message post processing not supported by Evolution .
Click Add if you need multiple actions and click OK .
There is an easy shortcut for fast filter or search folder creation :
Right-click the message in the message list .
Select one of the items under the Create Rule From Message submenu .
Creating a rule based on a message opens the filter creation tool with some of the information about the message already filled in for your convenience .
If you have several filters that match a single message , they are all applied to the message in order , unless one of the filters has the Stop Processing action . If you use that action in a filter , the messages that it affects are not touched by other filters .
When you first open the Filters window , you are shown the list of filters sorted in the order in which they will be applied . You can move them up and down in the priority list by clicking the Up and Down buttons .
Select the filter to edit , then click Edit .
Make the desired corrections , then click OK twice .
Select the filter to remove , then click Remove .
If filters aren 't flexible enough , or you find yourself performing the same search again and again , consider a search folder . Search folders are an advanced way of viewing your email messages within Evolution . If you get a lot of mail or often forget where you put messages , search folders can help you keep things organized .
A search folder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational tools : it looks like a folder , it acts like a search , and you set it up like a filter . In other words , a conventional folder actually contains messages , but a search folder is a view of messages that might be in several different folders . The messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of criteria you choose in advance .
As messages that meet the search folder criteria arrive or are deleted , Evolution automatically adjusts the search folder contents . When you delete a message , it is erased from the folder in which it actually exists , as well as any search folders that display it .
The Unmatched Search Folder is the opposite of other search folders : it displays all messages that do not appear in other search folders .
If you use remote email storage like IMAP or Microsoft Exchange , and have created search folders to search through them , the Unmatched Search Folder also searches the remote folders . If you do not create any search folders that search remote mail stores , the Unmatched Search Folder does not search in them either .
Click Message & gt ; Create Rule , then select a search folder based on Subject , Sender , Recipient , or Mailing List .
Select Search & gt ; Create Search Folder From Search .
Perform this operation from the search results . Create a search folder from search is enabled only when you already have performed a search .
Select Edit & gt ; Search Folder
Type the name of the search folder in the Search name field .
Select your search criteria . For each criterion , you must first select which of the following parts of the message you want the search to examine . The criteria are almost similar to those for filters .
Expression ( for programmers only ) :
Match a message according to an expression you write in the Scheme language used to define filters in Evolution .
Checks whether the message matchs all the criteria listed .
Select which folders will be used for the search folder . Your options are :
Uses all local folders for the search folder source in addition to individual folders that are selected .
Remote folders are considered active if you are connected to the server ; you must be connected to your mail server for the search folder to include any messages from that source in addition to individual folders that are selected .
All local and active remote folders :
Uses all local and active remote folders for the search folder source in addition to individual folders that are selected .
Uses individual folders for the search folder source .
If you select Specific folders only ,
click Add button to open the Select folder window .
Select the folder and press Add button .
You can view the folder added to the list in the entry box at the bottom of the New Search Folder window .
Evolution can check for junk mail for you . Evolution uses SpamAssassin and / or Bogofilter with trainable Bayesian filters to perform the spam check . When the software detects mail that appears to be junk mail , it will flag it and hide it from your view . Messages that are flagged as junk mail are displayed only in the Junk folder .
The junk mail filter can learn which kinds of mail are legitimate and which are not if you train it . When you first start using junk mail blocking , check the Junk folder to be sure that legitimate mail doesn 't get flagged as junk mail . If legitimate mail is incorrectly flagged , remove it from the Junk folder by right-clicking it and selecting Mark as Not Junk or pressing Shift + Ctrl + J. If Evolution misses junk mail , right-click the message , then click Mark as Junk or press Ctrl + J.

Most of the items in the contact editor simply display the information you enter , but some of them have additional features :
Select one of your address books as the location for this contact . You might not be able to write to all available address books , especially those on a network .
Click the Personal Information tab to enter Web addresses for the contact . If the contact publishes free / busy or calendar data online , using a server other than Exchange or GroupWise , you can specify the addresses for those servers here . After you do so , you can check their schedules when creating appointments in the calendar .
Follow the steps given below to create a new card .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Contact .
Enter the contact information to the entry boxes provided .
If you want to change a card that already exists ,
Go to the Contacts window by selecting View & gt ; Window & gt ; Contacts from the menubar .

To configure your Google Address Book in Evolution contacts :
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Address Book .
Select Google from the Type drop-down list .
Specify a name for the address book .
Select or deselect the following options and provide the username for the Google account :
Select this option to make the Google address book as your default address book .

To perform quick search , use the following procedure :
Evolution allows you to organize your contacts . You can create several individual address books , or contact lists . Within a given address book , you can have several categories of contacts .
Contact groups are nothing but address books . The simplest way to organize contacts is to create additional address books . You can create a new one by clicking File & gt ; New & gt ; Address Book . For contacts groups on your computer , you only need to provide a name . For contacts on the network , you need to provide more information about the contacts server you are trying to access .
To move a card from one group to another , just drag it from the main display of contacts and drop it to a different group . You cannot change the contents of most network contact groups .
Contacts groups are not the same as contact lists . A contact group is like a folder or address book full of contacts . A contact list is a single contact that contains other contacts , and is most often used to email several people at once .
You can import contacts from other contact management tools with the Import tool .
Mail yourself a contact as a vCard attachment .
Currently VCF and LDIF are supported . CSV and TAB format files are supported from Microsoft Outlook , Thunderbird , Mozilla , and Evolution .
A contact list is a set of contacts with a single nickname that you create . When you send email to the nickname , it is sent to every member of the list . This differs from a network mailing list in that it exists only on your computer as a convenience to you , rather than as an actual email address managed by a mailing list application on a server .
Open the list creation window by clicking the New List button .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Contact List .
Specify a name for the list .
Specify the names or email addresses of contacts .
Drag contacts from the main window into the list .
Choose whether you want to hide the email addresses when you send a message to the list .
Bcc : Specifying Additional Recipients for Email
When you are finished , click OK .
The list appears as a contact card , which you can use as you would any other card , including mailing the list to another person and sending email to the list .
To mail the list , open a new email and type the name you chose for the list . Evolution addresses the message to the entire list when you send the message . You can also right-click the list 's address card in the contacts tool and select Send Message to List .
Evolution cannot store contact lists on Microsoft Exchange servers .
To mark a card as belonging to a category ,
Double click the card to bring up the Contact Editor window
Click the Categories button at the left .
Select the category from the list . You can select as many or as few categories as you like .
If the master list of categories doesn 't suit you , you can add your own categories . To add a new category ,
Enter the new category in the entry box at the top .
You can view the category name in the field next to Categories button in the Contact Editor window .
You can edit or set the color and icon for each categories available under categories list . To achieve that click the Edit button at the bottom of the Categories window . Press the Delete button to delete the items from the list .
Network folders are only available when you are connected to the network . If you use a laptop or have a modem connection , you might want to copy or cache some of the network directory . You do this by dragging and dropping your desired contacts into the local address books .
You can also mark the network folder for offline usage . To mark the folder , right-click the folder , click Properties and select Copy Folder Content Locally for Offline Operation .
To prevent excess network traffic , Evolution does not normally load data from the LDAP server upon opening .
Depending on your server settings , you might not be able to edit all the fields in a contact stored on an LDAP server . Some servers prohibit some or all changes , and others use a smaller set of fields than Evolution allows . Check with your system administrator if you need different settings .
Multiple Calendars , Web Calendars , and CalDAV
In Evolution , you can keep multiple calendars and overlay them one over the next . For example , you might have a schedule of events for work , one for home , and one for your favorite sports team . The side bar lists those calendars , and you can select or deselect the boxes next to them to show and hide the appointments in your calendar view . By hiding and showing different sets of appointments , you can be sure to avoid conflicts , while keeping a minimum of clutter in your view .
Appointments for each calendar appear as a different color .
The toolbar offers you five different buttons that can show you different views of your calendar .
You can also select an arbitrary range of days in the small calendar in the side bar . To do this , select the days that you want to view in your calendar .
The Previous and Next buttons move you forward and back in your calendar pages . If you are using a week or month view , you can move by week or month . To return to today 's listing , click the Today button in the toolbar .
To visit calendar entries for a specific date , click Go To and select the date in the dialog box that appears .
Evolution allows you to edit the label of your calendar , assign color , and copy content for offline use . To set your calendar properties

Specify a name for the Google calendar .
Set the time to automatically refresh the calendar .
If you want to set a color label for the calendar , click the Color tab , select the desired color , then click OK .
If you want to view the calendar items offline , select Copy calendar content locally for offline operation check box .
If you select this option , you cannot modify or create the calendar items .
There are two types of events you can schedule with Evolution : appointments and meetings . An appointment is an event you schedule for yourself only , and a meeting is an event that you schedule multiple people for . You can also use the busy / free search for meetings to determine the availability of invitees .
Publishing Calendar and Free / Busy Information Without a Groupware Server
In Evolution , an appointment is an event you schedule for yourself .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Appointment .
Click Calendars on the Switcher , then click File , then New & gt ; Appointment .
Double-click in a blank space on the calendar view to open an Appointment dialog box . The particular time on the calendar view against which you have double clicked on will be suggested for the new appointment .
Select the required duration on the calender view and enter the summary .
Select a calendar in the Calendar drop-down list .
Enter a brief summary in the Summary field .
( Optional ) Type a location in the Location field .
To select this appointment as an all day event , click Options & gt ; All Day Event .
Click the All Day Event button on the toolbar .
If the event is an all day event , specify a starting date and an ending date .
If the event is not an all day event , specify a starting time and an ending time .
Select For to specify the duration .

( Optional ) Click the Recurrence button on the toolbar .
Click Options & gt ; Recurrence , and specify whether you want the appointment to recur and how often .
An All Day event appears at the top of a day 's appointment list , in the header under the date , rather than inside . That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit inside each other . For example , a conference might be an All Day appointment , and the meetings at the conference could be timed appointments . Appointments with specific starting and ending times can also overlap . When they do they display as multiple columns in the day view of the calendar .
If you create calendar appointments that overlap , Evolution displays them side by side in your calendar .
You can have several Reminders for individual appointments , any time prior to the appointment you schedule . You can have one reminder of each of the following types :
A notification pops up on your screen to remind you of your appointment .
Your computer delivers a sound alarm .
You can run a program as a reminder . You can enter its name in the text field , or find it with the Browse button .
Apart from the above notifications , the Evolution alarm icon blinks in the notification area . To pause the alarm or view the event , click the notification icon .
To create an alarm for this appointment , click Alarms on the toolbar , or click Options , then Alarms .
If you have stored reminders in a local calendar , they work from the moment you log in . However , for reminders stored on any remote server like GroupWise or Exchange which requires authentication , you must run Evolution at least once after logging in . No matter where the reminders are stored , you can quit Evolution and still be reminded of an upcoming appointment .
If you are using a Novell GroupWise or Microsoft Exchange server , other people on the server can check your schedule to see if you are available at any given time . If you have an appointment that is flexible or that you want to designate as Free rather than Busy time , select the Free box in the Show Time As section . Normally , appointments display as Busy .
You can categorize appointments in the same way you can categorize contacts .
Select the check box next to each category that matches the appointment you are creating .
You can add a new category to your category list by clicking Edit Master Category List , then click Click Here To Add A Category .
After you have selected your categories , click OK to assign these categories to the appointment . The categories you selected are now listed in the text box to the right of the Categories button .
Appointments with categories appear with icons in the calendar display , and you can also search for appointments by category . To display only the appointments in a particular category , select the corresponding category in the search bar at the top of the calendar .
Every two weeks on Monday and Friday until January 3 , 2008 Every month on the first Friday for 12 occurrences .
After you have finished settings , click the Save button in the toolbar to save and close the appointment editor window . If you want , you can alter an appointment summary in the calendar view by clicking it and typing . You can change other settings by right-clicking the appointment then choosing Open , or double-clicking the appointment .
A meeting is an event you schedule for multiple people . Evolution can be used to schedule group meetings and help you manage responses to meeting requests .
If you don 't need to collect attendance information when you 're scheduling an event , and would rather just announce the event , right-click the meeting and select Forward as iCalendar . This opens a new email message with the event notification attached as an announcement . Recipients can add the event to their calendars with one click , but it won 't automatically send you email about whether they plan to attend .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Meeting .
If you have multiple email accounts , select the one to use by selecting an item in the Organizer field .
Click Add to add the email addresses of people you want to invite .
To remove an attendee from the list , select an attendee and press Remove .
To edit a field , select the field and click Edit .
Click View on the menu bar to show or hide the Type , Role , Status , and RSVP fields .
To query free / busy information for the attendees , click the Free / Busy button on the toolbar .
Click Options & gt ; Free / Busy .
Click Save to save the meeting .
An email is sent out to all the recipients , inviting them to your event .
In Evolution , a meeting can have only one organizer , and only the organizer can add participants to that meeting . Though it is possible to change the organizer of a meeting , this is not recommended as a means to invite additional participants to meetings . If you want to invite additional people to a meeting and are not that meeting 's organizer , it is recommended that you forward the invitation message you received from the original meeting organiser to additional participants .
Meeting requests are sent as iCal attachments . To view or respond to one , click the attachment icon and view it inline in the mail window . All the details are shown about the event , including time and dates . Then you can choose how to reply to the invitation . Your choices are :
Click OK to send an email to the organizer with your answer . The event is also added to your calendar if you accept .
After you add the meeting to your calendar , you can make changes to the information , but if the original organizer sends out another update , your changes might be overwritten .
When you get a reply to a meeting invitation you sent , you can view it inline by clicking the attachment and selecting View Inline .
If you are in a hurry and you want to see the details of a meeting , mouse over the meeting in the calendar view . A tool tip appears with the details of the meeting . It will provide the agenda of the meeting , venue and time . If you are the organizer of the meeting , you can also view the status of the attendees , e.g. how many of them have accepted or declined the meeting request .
In addition to the standard meeting scheduling tools , you can use the Free / Busy view to check whether people are available in advance . The Free / Busy feature is normally a function of dedicated groupware servers such as Microsoft Exchange and Novell GroupWise . However , you can also publish Free / Busy information online , and access Free / Busy information published elsewhere . If not everyone you collaborate with publishes Free / Busy data , you can still use iCal event invitations to coordinate schedules with other people .
Click the Free / Busy button on the toolbar , or click Options & gt ; Free / Busy .
Adjust the meeting time , either by dragging the meeting borders or by using the Autopick buttons to choose a time automatically , then click Save and Close . Attendees on an Exchange server have the appointment updated automatically ; others receive email notification of any change in plans .
The Attendee List shows the people who have been invited to the appointment .
The Schedule Grid shows the published Free / Busy information for the people you have invited . This is where you compare schedules to find free time to schedule the appointment . Individuals have visible scheduling information only if they use the same Novell GroupWise or Microsoft Exchange server you do ( that is , if they are in the same organization as you ) , or if they publish free / busy information at a URL you can reach and you have entered that URL into their contact cards using the contact editor .
You can publish Calendar and Free / Busy information to a WebDAV , FTP server , or remote machine through secure shell or other Web server with HTTP PUT support . Check with your system administrator if you are not sure you have this functionality .
To set up Calendar or Free / Busy publishing :
Click Edit & gt ; Preferences , then click Calendar and Tasks .
Click the Calendar Publishing tab , click Add , then select the information you want to publish .

Only attendees of a meeting can delegate a meeting .
In the Calendar , right-click the meeting you want to delegate .
Select the contacts you want to delegate the meeting to .
Each contact receives a copy of the meeting invitation .
Multiple Calendars , Web Calendars and CalDAV
To create a new calendar , click File & gt ; New & gt ; Calendar . If the calendar is one you plan to store locally , you need only provide a name and color . If it is a remote calendar , specify the name , color , URL , and a refresh frequency . The refresh frequency determines how often Evolution checks to see if the calendar has changed . If you are working with someone who publishes an online calendar , you might want to check for updates every thirty minutes . On the other hand , if you have displayed a sports team schedule in your calendar , you might not need to refresh it more than once a week .
Evolution lets you view and manage calendars on remote CalDAV servers . The procedure to create a CalDAV calendar source is similar to that of a remote Web calendar source . You can view and create calendar events on CalDav accounts just like other calendars on Evolution .
You can view and manage local iCal or ics files in the Calendar view . Select the local iCal or ics files as calendar source to manage or view them in Evolution .

The Task List , located in the upper-right corner of the calendar , lets you keep a list of tasks separate from your calendar appointments .
You can use the list in a larger window by clicking the Tasks button in the side bar .
Task Lists are more easily organized in the dedicated Tasks tool . Each task list is assigned a color , and you can use the Tasks tool switcher to hide and show task lists just like calendars . In the calendar display task pad , tasks from all visible task lists appear , color coded by list .
Click File & gt ; New & gt ; Task List .
Specify the name and color for the task list .
( Optional ) If the task is an online list , specify the URL of the task list .

Click the icon next to the Time Zone field , then select your location .
Each red dot represents a major city .
Select a city , then click OK .
You can also configure time zone information specific to each appointment . To do that , simply create a new appointment and click the globe to customize the time zone that the time exists in . For example , if you live in New York but have a telephone meeting set for noon with someone in California , you need to make sure that your schedules are coordinated . Setting time zones on a per-appointment basis helps avoid that potential confusion .
The Marcus Bains Line is a marker to show the current date and time . This feature is available in the Evolution calendar .
Evolution Exchange works only with Exchange 2000 and later , and requires that Outlook Web Access be enabled . Each user needs a valid Microsoft Exchange server account , including a license .

After you have installed Evolution Exchange , you need to set up access for your Exchange account on both the Exchange server and within Evolution .
Configuring an Existing Account for Evolution Exchange Account
Check with your system administrator to ensure that :
You have a valid account on the Exchange server .
You are permitted to access the account with WebDAV . This is the default setting for the Exchange server , so unless your system administrator has specifically turned it off , no changes should be necessary .
When you know that your server is ready for you to connect , you are ready to add your Exchange account to Evolution Exchange .
Evolution Exchange comes with a simple account creation tool for Exchange accounts .
If you have no accounts configured , the simple account configuration assistant starts when you start Evolution . It asks only for the Outlook Web Access URL , and your username and password . Evolution Exchange determines the remaining information for you .
Only one Microsoft Exchange account can be configured in Evolution .
Use the following procedure to configure your existing account for Evolution Exchange :
Select the account you want to convert , then click Edit .
Click the Receiving Mail tab , then select Microsoft Exchange as your server type .
Type your user name , and the Outlook Web Access ( OWA ) URL . Click Authenticate , then enter the password at the prompt . The Exchange server authenticates your account .
Specify how often to check for new mail , your Global Catalog server name and whether to apply filters to messages in your Inbox , check for junk , set a password expiry period , and any other settings you want to include .
Use the Defaults tab to define folders , send CC or BCC messages to certain email addresses , and set options for message receipts .
Use the Security tab to set PGP and S / MIME options .
Changes to Evolution Exchange accounts configuration are not active until you have restarted the application .
When you have installed Evolution Exchange , you can access public folders and perform certain Exchange actions like delegation and password management , and subscribing to other user 's calendars , tasks , and contact folders . You can also carry out any folder-related operations like adding , deleting , and renaming folders , and selecting folder permissions on calendars , tasks , and contact folders . Use the regular Mail tool for mail , the Contacts tool for contacts , and the Calendar tool for setting schedules .
If you are using both an Exchange account and a local mail account , you should be aware that whenever you save an email address or appointment from an email message , it is saved in your Exchange contacts list or calendar , rather than in your local account . The same is true for synchronization with Palm OS devices ; tasks , and appointments . Addresses from your Palm OS device are synchronized in the Exchange folders rather than in local folders .
To avoid unnecessary strain on the server , the Global Address List ( GAL ) appears empty until you search for something in it .
You can set the priority and sensitivity of the sent message from an exchange account so that the recipients will know how important the message is . The priority can have one of the three options : High , Normal or Low ; and sensitivity can have one of the four options : Normal , Personal , Private and Confidential . You can also enable delivery receipt request and read receipt request for the messages sent .
Evolution lets you track the status of an item you have sent . You can enable the Delivery Receipt request as well as Read Receipt request so that you will know when the item reached the recipients or read by them .
To set the importance and sensitivity of the message :
Select the exchange account from the From field .
Click Insert & gt ; Send Options .
Select the priority for your sent message from the given three options ( Normal , High , Low ) .
Click Send as Delegate to send the message to the recipient on behalf of someone else .

Click User to open Show Contacts dialog box .
Select the contact from the desired Address book and click Add , then close the dialog box .
You are not permitted to send a message on behalf of more than one person at a time .
Select the Request a delivery receipt for this message check box to get a delivery receipt from your recipient .
Select the Request a read receipt for this message to get a read receipt for the message you have sent .
You can send Meetings or Appointments on behalf of someone else if you have subscribed to his or her Calendar .
When the recipient receives the calendar item , a message indicates that the item was created by someone on behalf of the Delegator .
You can allow other people in your organization 's Global Address List to access your calendar , address book , and messages , and they can let you manage theirs . Delegation allows people to do anything from check on each other 's schedules to completely manage their personal information .
To add someone to your list of delegates :
Click Delegation Assistant to open the Delegates dialog box .
Click Add , then search for a contact in the Global Address List .
Remember that the Global Address List ( GAL ) appears empty until you have searched for something in it .
Select the delegate and click Edit to open the delegate permission dialog box .
Select from the following access levels for each of the four types of folders :
Do not allow this person to access any folders of this type .
Allows the delegate to see items in this type of folder , but not create new items or edit existing items .
Author ( read , create ) :
The delegate can view items in your folders , and can create new items , but cannot change any existing items .
Editor ( read , create , edit ) :

You reach the Evolution settings window by clicking Edit & gt ; Preferences . In the left part of the settings window is a column , similar to the Evolution switcher , that lets you choose which portion of Evolution to customize . The right part of the window is where you make your actual changes .
There are six items you can customize .
Previous versions of Evolution included directory servers , folder settings , and Exchange delegation in the settings tool . Directory servers can now be set up as contacts groups in the Contacts tool , you can change folder settings in the folder right-click menu , and Exchange delegation is available in the Message Menu of the Exchange tool .
Evolution allows you to maintain multiple accounts , or identities . When you are writing an email message , you can choose which account to use by selecting from the drop-down list next to the From field in the message composer .
Click Send / Receive to update all mail sources that are not disabled . If you don 't want to check mail for a given account , select the account in Edit & gt ; Preferences , then Mail Accounts page and click the Disable button .

The Autocompletion tool lets you choose address books to auto-complete names for you in the mail composer . This functionality requires accessibility to each of the address books you want to use . To enable autocompletion , select each of the address books that you want to use auto completion in the Autocompletion page .
Evolution allows you to choose the headers that you want to download so that you can reduce the download time and filter or move your mail around the way you like it . Evolution helps you to customize your IMAP Mail header preferences and thus save the download time . The IMAP Mail header options are as follows :
All available IMAP mail headers for all the messages will be downloaded .
This will include Date , From , To , CC , Subject , Preferences , In-Reply-To , Message-ID , Mime-Version , and Content-Type . If you want to just fetch and see messages without having to categorically filter messages based on your mailing lists , choose this option . This will make Evolution work faster and is generally recommended for common users .
Enable this option to have filters based on mailing list headers ( like list ID ) so that in addition to the basic headers , the headers that correspond to mailing-lists are also fetched . Mailing list headers will have the informations such as the mailinglist-ID , owner of the mailing list , and so on with which you can create mailing list filters .
This is the default Header preference that comes with Evolution . When this option is chosen , Evolution will download a basic set of headers ( as described above ) along with a set of headers that are needed for client-side filters based on mailing lists . If you do not have any filters on Evolution , it is recommended to switch to the " Basic Headers Only " option .
On the Account Editor , click IMAP Headers tab to open IMAP Headers to the Account Editor .
Click Fetch All Headers to download all the available header information .
The more headers you have , the more time it will consume to download . This option is not recommended .
Click Basic Headers to download basic headers .
Click Basic and Mailing Headers to download both .
Click Add to add any predefined custom headers .
Click Remove to remove the custom headers .
The Mail Preferences tool lets you choose how to display citations , how long to wait before marking a message as read , and other mail display settings .
Normally , Evolution uses the same fonts as other GNOME applications . To choose different fonts , deselect Use the same fonts as other applications and select one font for standard typefaces and a second for monospace .
Fall back to threading message by subject Shrink To / CC / BCC header to Magic spacebar search folders
To group the messages as threads select View & gt ; Group By threads or press Ctrl + T.
Choose whether to delete messages automatically when quitting Evolution and how frequently , and whether you want to explicitly confirm the final deletion of messages . Select Confirm when expunging a folder to confirm the final deletion . You can have four different options to set the frequency for deletion : Everytime , Once per day , Once per week , and Once per month .
Evolution can alert you to the arrival of new mail with a beep or by playing a sound file . Choose your alert noise , or select none , as you prefer . You can choose not to notify on new mail arrival .
Turns image animation ( e.g. GIF files ) on or off .
Prompt When Sending HTML Messages to Contacts That Don 't Want Them :
Some people do not like HTML mail , and you can set Evolution to warn you of this preference . This warning appears only when you send HTML mail to people in your contacts who are listed as disliking HTML .
If you have chosen not to load images automatically , you can choose to see the images in one message at a time by selecting View & gt ; Load Images or press Ctrl + I.
The Label preferences option lets you add color labels for different kinds of messages . You can add , edit , or remove the labels . You can also assign colors to each label you create . You cannot remove the default labels .
Click Add and specify the name in the Label Name dialog box .
Click the color tab and select a color , then click OK .
Select the label and click Edit .
Edit name and color , then click OK .
To assign a label to a specific email message :
Right-click the message from the message preview .
Click Label and select the desired label for the message .
The headers on an incoming message are the information about the message that isn 't the content of the message itself , such as the sender and the time it was sent . Select the options here to show or hide different amounts of information about the messages you read . You can also add or remove new mail headers to the list . The default mail headers cannot be removed .
This feature adds support for viewing the photograph of the sender at the right side of the preview pane .
To enable this feature , select Edit & gt ; Preferences & gt ; Mail Preferences & gt ; Headers & gt ; Show the photograph of sender in the email preview . Deselect this option to disable this feature .
Search for sender photograph only in the local address book
This feature is disabled by default as it causes delay in fetching the messages .
You can check your incoming messages for junk content by using Bogofilter and SpamAssassin * tools , which have trainable Bayesian filters . You need to enable the Junk plugins to start filtering junk mail .
Select the junk plugins you want . You can select either Bogofilter or SpamAssassin , or you can select both .
You can check incoming email for junk contents and also decide how often you want to delete junk mail . You also have the option to choose either SpamAssassin or Bogofilter , or you can select both .
This option turns automatic junk mail filtering on or off .
This option deletes junk messages when you exit . You can also specify when to delete the junk messages ( every time , once per day , once per week , once per month ) .
Select either SpamAssassin or Bogofilter , or both , as your junk filter . You can view them only if you have enabled the respective plugins . When you select any option , it also reports if the underlying binary is available or not .
Remote Test performs junk mail filtering on remote servers . It also includes online tests , like checking for blacklisted message senders and ISPs .
This option uses tests that require a network connection , such as checking to see if a message is in a list of known junk messages , or if the sender or gateway are blacklisted by anti-spam organizations . Online tests can make filtering slower , because remote tests add to the amount of time it takes to check for junk mail , but they increase accuracy . When you select this option , you do not need to do any additional setup .
Check new messages for junk contents option under Edit & gt ; Preferences & gt ; Mail Accounts & gt ; Edit & gt ; Receiving options is enabled only for IMAP . Check incoming mail for junk option under Edit & gt ; Preferences & gt ; Mail Preferences & gt ; Junk & gt ; General refers only to POP and Local Delivery .
There are two items in this section : Automatic Contacts automatically adds people that you respond to into your address book . You can select the default address book for automatic contacts from the list .
Instant Messaging Contacts periodically synchronizes contact information and images with your instant messaging program . Currently this only works with Pidgin . Your address book must not be a read-only one for both these features to function properly .
Allows you to delete messages after you have acted on an appointment . It also allows you to select calendars to search for meeting conflicts .
There are three tabs for message composer settings where you can set the composer preferences . The General tab covers assorted behavior , the Signature tab sets your signature , and the Spell Checking tab controls spell checking .
Choose how to normally forward and reply to messages , what character set they will use , whether they are in HTML , and whether that HTML can contain graphic emoticons .
You can forward messages either as an attachment or inline , or else as quoted . Choose reply style from the drop-down list : Quote original message , Do not quote original message , Attach original message .
When replying , you can choose where to place your signature in the message . You can place the signature either above the original message or at the end of the composer window . Top Posting is not recommended because placing the signature other than at the end of the message is against the mailing standards .
There are two optional alerts you can select :
Prompt When Sending Messages With an Empty Subject Line :
The composer warns you if you try to send a message without a subject .
Prompt When Sending Messages with Only Bcc Recipients Defined :
The composer warns you if you try to send a message that has only Bcc recipients . This is important because some mail servers fail to transmit blind carbon copy if you do not have at least one recipient that is visible to all readers .
The signature editor allows you to create several different signatures in plain text or in HTML , and to specify which of them will be added to email you create in the message composer . If you prefer to use an alternate signature or none at all , you can select it from the mail composer itself .
To choose a spell-checking language , select it here . You must install gnome-spell , aspell , and an aspell language package ( like for example aspell-en for english language ) for spell-checking to be available in Evolution . Additional dictionaries are available through your package manager and are detected automatically if you have installed them . To have the composer automatically check your spelling while you type , select Check Spelling While I Type . You can set the color for misspelled words .

This interface lets you configure your network proxy settings .
Select this option to connect directly to the internet .
The port for the machine defined by the Secure HTTP Proxy port field .
The port for the machine defined by the SOCKS host .
This key contains a list of hosts which are connected to directly , rather than via the proxy ( if it is active ) . The values can be hostnames , domains ( using an initial wildcard like * .example.com ) , IP host addresses ( both IPv4 and IPv6 ) and network addresses with a netmask similar to 192.168.0.0 / 24 .
If this option is enabled , it uses authentication to connect via the proxy server .
Username used to authenticate when performing an HTTP proxying .
Password used to authenticate when performing an HTTP proxying .
Evolution allows you to add certificates for yourself as well as for contacts . This allows you to communicate with others securely over an encrypted connection , or sign a message confirming your identity to the contact . These settings only apply to S / MIME encryption .
Click the Your Certificates tab to display a list of certificates that you own . You can import , view and delete your certificates from this page .

Creates an address book on the LDAP server .
If you have an account that allows you to create an address book on that server , you can select that account .
If you selected On This Computer , specify the name of the address book , and choose whether you want to the new address book as your default folder .
The Internet address of the contact server you are using .
Specify whether your login is anonymous , uses an email address , or uses a distinguished name . If the login is not anonymous , specify the email address or distinguished name ( DN ) required by the server .
The Internet port Evolution connects to in order to access the LDAP database . This is normally 389 .
SSL and TLS are security mechanisms . If you select No Encryption , Evolution will send your password unencrypted . By using SSL or TLS , a secure connection will be used and your password will be sent encrypted .
Searches the Search Base and one entry below it .
Searches the Search Base and all entries below it .
The maximum time Evolution attempts to download data from the server before giving up .
The maximum number of results for a given search . Most servers refuse to send more than 500 , but you can set the number lower if you want to shorten downloads for very broad searches .
The name you want to use as a label for this folder . It can be any name you choose .
The search filter can be set here for all the LDAP queries . For example :
ObjectClass = * : Lists all the objects from the server.ObjectClass = User : Lists only the users . Filter ( | ( ObjectClass = User ) ( ObjectClass = groupOfNames ) ) : Retrieves the User and Contact List objects . ( amp ; ( mail = * ) ( ObjectClass = * ) ) : Lists the objects associated with the email addresses .
If you change any LDAP address book configurations , Evolution and the Evolution Data Server need to be restarted in order to see the changes .
If you are creating the address book for a specific account , type the name of the address book if you want the address book stored locally when offline , and if you want the address book to be your default folder .
Evolution allows you to view the error logs and set the display duration for the error messages that appear in the statusbar . When an error occurs , statusbar displays the error message for the specified time , then it is moved to the debug file .
From the Help menu , select Debug Logs .
Specify for how long error messages will be displayed in the statusbar .
If you haven 't used a handheld device with your computer before , you need to run the GNOME Control Center by clicking System & gt ; Settings , and make sure that Pilot Link is properly configured . Make sure that you have read and write permissions on the device , which is normally in / dev / pilot . If that does not work , check in / dev / ttyS0 if you have a serial connection , or in / dev / ttyUSB1 for a USB connection . You can do this by becoming root and adding your username to the group that owns this device node . For a USB device on sync , two device nodes are created , ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1 . The second node is the one to be used in configuring the device .
Click Enable , then click Settings to change what the conduit does when activated . Your options can vary depending on the conduit , but typically they are as follows :
Copy new data from the computer to the handheld , and from the handheld to the computer . Remove items that were on both systems but have been deleted on one .
If there is any new data on the handheld device , copy it to the computer .
Copy new data from the computer to the handheld .
Select the behavior you want for each conduit you choose to use . If you 're not sure , use Synchronize .
Use the following procedure to synchronize the data on your Palm OS device with the data you store in Evolution .
Put your handheld device in its cradle and press the HotSync button .
If you use Palm OS v. 4.0 and have password protection turned on for your handheld device , you might encounter trouble synchronizing . If this happens , try turning off password protection on your handheld , synchronize it with your desktop computer , and then re-enable password protection on your handheld .
If you have followed the setup instructions properly , your Palm OS device will synchronize data with Evolution .
Exchange and IMAP mail is stored on the server , so you do not need to migrate it to your Linux * partition . However , if you have stored mail on your computer , you might want to make it accessible to Evolution .
First , while using Windows , prepare your messages for import :
Clean up your mail . Delete messages and folders you do not need , and click File & gt ; Folders & gt ; Properties & gt ; Advanced & gt ; Compact to erase old , deleted messages from your PST file .
If you nest your folders one inside another , you might want to rename subfolders so that you can tell which folder they belong to . You must re-nest them after you load them into Evolution .
Import the files into Mozilla Mail ( or another mailer , such as Netscape or Eudora , that uses the standard mbox format ) .
Linux mailers cannot do this task , because it requires a library available only under Windows . In Mozilla , import by selecting Window Mail & Newsgroups Tools Import .
If you are using Windows Vista * , Windows XP * or Windows 2000 * , your Windows hard drive is probably in the NTFS format , which some Linux systems cannot read without additional software . You might find it simpler to copy the mail folders to a different drive or to burn a CD .
When you have your mail in a format Evolution can understand , reboot to Linux . Then continue with the following procedure . To create new folders for your files :
Mount your Windows drive or the disk where you saved the mail files .
Copy all the mail files into your home directory or another convenient place .
Select File & gt ; New & gt ; Mail Folder to create the folders you want .
In Evolution , open the File Import assistant by clicking File & gt ; Import .
Click Next , then select Import a single file .

A tool that guides a user through a series of steps , usually to configure or set up a program . Equivalent to Wizard and Druid .
Any file sent with an email . Attachments can be embedded in a message or appended to it .
A feature which allows Evolution to quickly find and sort data .
Blind copy recipients ( Bcc ) receive a copy of an item . Other recipients receive no information about blind copies . Only the sender and the blind copy recipient know that a blind copy was sent . If a recipient replies and chooses Reply to All , the blind copy recipient does not receive the reply .
Carbon copy recipients ( CC ) receive a copy of an item . CC recipients are users who would benefit from the information in an item , but are not affected by or directly responsible for it . All recipients can see that a carbon copy was sent . They can also see the names of the CC recipients .
A small application that controls the transfer of data between a handheld device and a desktop computer .
To run a program . Any file that can be run is called an executable . Evolution can download executable attachments , but before they can be run , the files must be marked as executable with a shell or file manager . This security precaution prevents the automatic or accidental execution of malicious programs . For more information on executables and file permissions , see the documentation for your file manager or shell .
When messages are marked for deletion , they remain until they are expunged . When a message is expunged , it is permanently deleted , as long as it was marked for deletion .
Within Evolution , a filter is a method of sorting mail automatically when it is downloaded . You can create filters to perform one or more actions on a message that meets any ( or all ) of a wide range of criteria .
Forwards a copy of the message and any additional comments to a different email address .
A term describing an application that helps groups of people work together . Typically , a groupware application has several productivity features built into one program , including email , calendar , and address book tools .
Hypertext Markup Language ( HTML ) is a language for describing page layout in electronic documents such as Web pages , help files , and email messages . HTML can be used in email and news posts to insert images and apply text treatments .
iCal is a protocol that Evolution uses to manage the calendar section .
Internet Mail Access Protocol . It allows access to email that is typically stored remotely on a server rather than on a local hard disk . Often contrasted with POP .
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol . Allows a client to search through a large database of addresses , phone numbers , and people stored on a server .
The application with which a person reads and sends email . Its counterparts are the various types of mail servers , which handle user authentication and direct messages from the sender to the recipient .
Post Office Protocol . A mechanism for email transport . In contrast to IMAP , it is used only to get mail from a server and store it locally on your hard disk .
An agreed-upon method of communication , especially one for sending particular types of information between computer systems . Examples include POP ( Post Office Protocol ) , for email , and HTTP ( HyperText Transfer Protocol ) for Web pages .
A strong encryption method that uses a set of two keys , one of which is made public , and one of which is kept private . Data encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key . The longer the keys , the more difficult it is to break the encryption .
fly soup soap . fly in my soup fly in my soap . man grep
A program written in an interpreted ( rather than compiled ) language . Often used as a synonym for macro , to denote a series of prerecorded commands or actions within an application . Scripts are used to accomplish repetitive and tedious tasks , to save the user time .
LDAP can break contact lists into many groups . The search base tells LDAP the top group to use . How much of the Search Base to search is set by the Search Scope option .
An email organization tool . Search folders allow you to create a folder that contains the results of a complex search . Search folder contents are updated dynamically .
Search Scope states how much of the search base to search .
A program that sends mail . Evolution can use it instead of SMTP ; some people prefer it because it offers more flexibility ; however , it is more difficult to set up .
An area of Evolution that offers users fast access to the most frequently used features of the application .
Text placed at the end of every email sent , similar to a hand-written signature at the bottom of a written letter . A signature can be anything from a favorite quotation to a link to a Web page ; courtesy dictates that it be fewer than four lines long .
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol . The most common way of transporting mail messages from your computer to the server .
A small box of explanatory text that appears when the mouse pointer is held over a button or other interface element .
A program that inserts itself into other files or programs . When executed , it spreads to more programs and other computers . A virus can cause substantial damage by clogging networks or disk drives , deleting files , or opening security holes .
A file format for the exchange of contact information . When you get an address card attached to an email , it is probably in vCard format .
