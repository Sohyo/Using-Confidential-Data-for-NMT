Powder and solvent for solution for injection
After reconstitution , the solution is clear , colourless , free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3 .
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU
2 factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor ) , doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE. .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 1 gemeldet . 1
Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention : very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000 ) , very rare ( < 1/ 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be calculated from the available data ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials :
Table 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) in clinical trials
Chest pain Chills Feeling abnormal Investigations Anti-factor VIII antibody positive
a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
6 The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 2 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions . ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Hämophilie A ist eine geschlechtsgebundene , erbliche Störung der Blutgerinnung aufgrund erniedrigter Faktor VIII-Spiegel . The plasma levels of factor VIII are
2 paediatric patients ( age 0 16 years ) and adult patients ( age over 16 years )
7 increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .
Table 3 Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for ADVATE in 100 patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( factor VIII 2 % ) PK Parameter AUC0- ( IU h/ dl ) t1/ 2 ( h ) Adjusted Recovery
( IU/ dl/ IU/ kg ) Cmax ( IU/ dl ) Clearance ( dl/ kg h ) MRT ( h ) VSS ( dl/ kg ) * Geometric mean
Data from single-dose administrations of ADVATE in 53 paediatric patients less than 6 years of age were used to obtain this table .

( IU/ dl/ IU/ kg ) Cmax ( IU/ dl ) Clearance ( dl/ kg h ) MRT ( h ) VSS ( dl/ kg ) * Geometric Mean
Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life ( t1/ 2 ) was approximately 20 % lower in young children ( less than 6 years of age ) than in adults , which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients .
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology , acute toxicology , repeated dose toxicity , local toxicity and genotoxicity .

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
12 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :

Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 13 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
16 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 4 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 17 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

Powder and solvent for solution for injection .
After reconstitution , the solution is clear , colourless , free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3 .
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
22 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 23 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
24 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 5 gemeldet . 5
Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention : very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000 ) , very rare ( < 1/ 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be calculated from the available data ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials :
Table 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) in clinical trials
Headache Dizziness Memory impairment Tremor Migraine Dysgeusia
5 Neonates ( age 0 1 month ) , infants ( age 1 month 2 years ) , children ( age 2 - 12 years ) , adolescents ( age 12 - 16 years ) and adults ( age over 16 years )
25 Table 2 Frequency of adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) in clinical trials
Respiratory , thoracic and Dyspnoea mediastinal disorders
a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
26 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 6 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 27 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

Powder and solvent for solution for injection .
After reconstitution , the solution is clear , colourless , free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3 .
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
32 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 33 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
34 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 7 gemeldet . 7
Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention : very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000 ) , very rare ( < 1/ 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be calculated from the available data ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials :

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
36 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 8 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 37 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life ( t1/ 2 ) was approximately 20 % lower in young children ( less than 6 years of age ) than in adults , which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients .
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available .

Powder and solvent for solution for injection .
After reconstitution , the solution is clear , colourless , free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.7 to 7.3 .
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A ( congenital factor VIII deficiency ) .
ADVATE does not contain von Willebrand Factor in pharmacologically effective quantities and is therefore not indicated in von Willebrand disease .
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia .
Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient s clinical condition .
On demand treatment The dose of factor VIII ( FVIII)is expressed in International Units ( IU ) , which are related to the WHO standard for factor VIII products .
Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a percentage ( relative to normal human plasma ) or in IUs ( relative to the international standard for factor VIII in plasma ) .
42 One IU of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml of normal human plasma .
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 43 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
44 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 9 gemeldet . 9
Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention : very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000 ) , very rare ( < 1/ 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be calculated from the available data ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials :

a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
46 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 10 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 47 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .

The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/ dl .
The dose is determined using the following formula :
Required units ( IU ) = body weight ( kg ) x desired factor VIII rise ( % ) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level ( in % of normal or IU/ dl ) in the corresponding period .
The followingtable 1 can be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery :
Table 1 Guide for dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery Degree of haemorrhage/ type of surgical procedure Haemorrhage
Factor VIII level required ( % or IU/ dl )
Frequency of doses ( hours)/ duration of therapy ( days )
Early haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or oral bleeding .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for at least 1 day , until the bleeding episode , as indicated by pain , is resolved or healing is achieved .
More extensive haemarthrosis , muscle bleeding or haematoma .
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours ( 8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) for 3 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until threat is resolved .
Every 24 hours ( 12 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) , at least 1 day , until healing is achieved .
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours ( 6 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6 ) until adequate wound healing , then continue therapy for at least another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII activity of 30 % to 60 % ( IU/ dl ) .
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual case .
Under certain circumstances ( e. g. presence of a low titre inhibitor ) doses larger than those calculated using the formula may be necessary .
During the course of treatment , appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections .
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular , precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 53 factor VIII activity assay is indispensable .
Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives .
Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A , the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
In patients under the age of 6 , doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 times weekly are recommended .
Patients should be monitored for the development of factor VIII inhibitors .
If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained , or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present .
In patients with high levels of inhibitor , factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered .
The management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of patients with haemophilia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Method of administration ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route .
In case of administration by a non health care professional appropriate training is needed .
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min .
In the interest of patients , it is recommended that every time ADVATE is administered , the name and batch number of the product should be recorded .
For instructions for reconstitution prior to administration , see section 6.6 .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse or hamster proteins .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
As with any intravenous protein product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible .
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins .
Patients should be informed of the signs of immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions including hives , pruritus , generalised urticaria , angioedema , hypotension ( e. g. dizziness or syncope ) , shock and acute respiratory distress ( e. g. tightness in the chest , wheezing ) .
If these symptoms occur , they should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physicians .
In case of anaphylactic shock , the current medical standards for shock treatment should be implemented ( see section 4.8 ) .
The formation of neutralising antibodies ( inhibitors ) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.
These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity , which are quantified in Bethesda Units ( BU ) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay .
In patients who develop inhibitors to factor VIII , the condition may manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response .
In such cases , it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted .
The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII , the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days , and to other genetic and environmental factors .
Rarely , inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor ( low titre ) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development .
Patients treated with coagulation factor VIII should be carefully monitored for the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests ( see section 4.8 ) .
After reconstitution this medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium ( 10 mg ) per vial .
To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
54 No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII .
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women , experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast- feeding is not available .
Therefore , factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
Wie bei jedem intravenös zu verabreichenden Protein sind Überempfindlichkeitsreaktionen vom allergischen Typ möglich ( siehe Abschnitt 4.4 ) . ( see section 4.4 ) .
During clinical studies with ADVATE , a total of 56 adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were reported in 27 of 234 unique treated patients .
The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors ( 5 patients ) , all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
Von den insgesamt 56 Nebenwirkungen wurden keine bei Neugeborenen beobachtet , 16 wurden bei 13/32 Kleinkindern , 7 bei 4/56 Kindern , 8 bei 4/31 Jugendlichen und 25 bei 14/94 Erwachsenen 11 gemeldet . 11
Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention : very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000 ) , very rare ( < 1/ 10,000 ) , not known ( cannot be calculated from the available data ) .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
The following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials :

Respiratory , thoracic and Dyspnoea mediastinal disorders
a ) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery ( postoperative days 10-14 ) .
Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.
Factor VIII inhibitor assays performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative .
56 Inhibitor Development The immunogenicity of ADVATE was evaluated in previously treated patients .
During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 12 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 150 days , one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor ( 2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay ) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE .
Follow-up inhibitor tests in this patient after withdrawal from the study were negative .
Also , in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6 , also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( FVIII 2 % ) , with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates 50 days , no FVIII inhibitor was detected .
In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 ( 20 % ) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII .
Of those , 4 were high-titre ( 5 BU ) and 1 was low-titre ( < 5 BU ) .
The frequency of FVIII inhibitors detected so far is within the expected and previously observed range .
The patient s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell protein , 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres by linear regression analysis and 4 displayed sustained peaks or transient spikes .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level , but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response .
Of the 182 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG , 10 showed a statistically significant upward trend by linear regression analysis and 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike .
One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-murine IgG antibody level .
Four of these patients reported isolated events of urticaria , pruritus , rash , and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst numerous repeated exposures to the study product .
As with other intravenous products , allergic type hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis/ anaphylactoid reactions , have been reported with ADVATE ( frequency not known ) .
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported .
The factor VIII/ von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules ( factor VIII and von Willebrand factor ) with different physiological functions .
ADVATE contains recombinant coagulation factor VIII ( octocog alfa ) , a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII glycoprotein found in human plasma .
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass of 280 kD .
When infused into a haemophilia patient , octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand Factor in the patient s circulation .
Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX , accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X.
Activated Factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin .
Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed .
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints , muscles or internal organs , either
Dies führt , entweder spontan oder in Folge unfallbedingter oder chirurgischer Traumata , zu starken Blutungen in Gelenken , Muskeln oder inneren Organen . 57 spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma .
The plasma levels of factor VIII are increased by replacement therapy , thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency .
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII 2 % ) .
The analysis of plasma samples was conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay .
The pharmacokinetic parameters derived from a crossover study of ADVATE in 100 previously treated patients 10 years of age are listed in table 3 below .
Table 3 Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for ADVATE in 100 patients with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A ( factor VIII 2 % ) Interquartile PK Parameter

( IU/ dl/ IU/ kg ) Cmax ( IU/ dl ) Clearance ( dl/ kg h ) MRT ( h ) VSS ( dl/ kg ) * Geometric Mean
Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life ( t1/ 2 ) was approximately 20 % lower in young children ( less than 6 years of age ) than in adults , which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients .
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available .
