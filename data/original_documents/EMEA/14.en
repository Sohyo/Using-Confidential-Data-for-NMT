For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women in men at increased risk of fracture , including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture .
Treatment of Paget s disease of the bone .
For the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men , the recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta administered once a year .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair ( see section 5.1 ) .
For the treatment of Paget s disease , Aclasta should be prescribed only by physicians with experience in treatment of Paget s disease of the bone .
The recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta .
Retreatment of Paget s disease : specific retreatment data are not available .
After a single treatment with Aclasta in Paget s disease , an extended remission period is observed in responding patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
Aclasta ( 5 mg in 100 ml ready-to-infuse solution ) is administered via a vented infusion line and given at a constant infusion rate .
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes .
For information on the infusion of Aclasta , see section 6.6 .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta .
This is especially important for the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
2 Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget s disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.4 ) .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion .
The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration .
Patients with renal impairment ( see section 4.4 ) Use of Aclasta in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min is not recommended due to limited clinical experience in this population .
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 35 ml/ min .
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required ( see section 5.2 ) .
Elderly patients ( 65 years ) No dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability , distribution and elimination were similar in elderly patients and younger subjects .
Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates .
Aclasta is contraindicated for patients with hypocalcaemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Aclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women ( see section 4.6 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minutes .
Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min ) due to limited clinical experience in this population .
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta .
This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) , see section 4.5 .
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta ( see section 4.3 ) .
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated ( e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve , intestinal calcium malabsorption ) .
Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients .
3 Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget s disease of the bone .
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover , transient hypocalcaemia , sometimes symptomatic , may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta ( see section 4.8 ) .
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget 's disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk .
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease .
Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone , joint and/ or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates , including Aclasta .
Aclasta contains the same active substance found in Zometa ( zoledronic acid ) , used for oncology indications , and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with Aclasta .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported predominantly in patients with cancer receiving treatment regimens including bisphosphonates , including zoledronic acid .
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids .
The majority of reported cases have been associated with dental procedures such as tooth extraction .
Many had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis .
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors ( e. g. cancer , chemotherapy , corticosteroids , poor oral hygiene ) .
While on treatment , these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible .
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy , dental surgery may exacerbate the condition .
For patients requiring dental procedures , there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw .
The clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Specific drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with zoledronic acid .
Zoledronic acid is not systemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro ( see section 5.2 ) .
Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 43-55 % bound ) and interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are therefore unlikely .
Zoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) .
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women .
Studies in animals with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicological effects including malformations ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human breast milk .
Aclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women ( see section 4.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
The overall percentage of patients who experienced post-dose symptoms were 44.7 % , 16.7 % and 10.2 % after the first , second and third infusion , respectively .
Incidence of individual symptoms following the first infusion was : fever ( 17.1 % ) , myalgia ( 7.8 % ) , flu-like symptoms ( 6.7 % ) , arthralgia ( 4.8 % ) and headache ( 5.1 % ) .
The incidence of these symptoms decreased markedly with subsequent doses of Aclasta .
The majority of these symptoms occur within the first three days following Aclasta administration .
The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate and resolved within three days of the event onset .
The percentage of patients who experienced post-dose symptoms was lower in a smaller study ( 19.5 % , 10.4 % , 10.7 % after the first , second and third infusion , respectively ) , where prophylaxis against post-dose symptoms was used as described below .
The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
In the HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial [ PFT ] ( see section 5.1 ) , the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5 % ( 96 out of 3,862 ) and 1.9 % ( 75 out of 3,852 ) in patients receiving Aclasta and placebo , respectively .
The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Aclasta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 out of 3,862 ) compared with patients receiving placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 out of 3,852 ) .
The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is unknown .
In the osteoporosis trials ( PFT , HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [ RFT ] ) the pooled atrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between Aclasta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
For atrial fibrillation serious adverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3 % for Aclasta and 0.8 % for placebo .
Very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 , < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 , < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 , < 1/ 1,000 ) adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 1.
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Blood pressure increased Atrial fibrillation Headache , dizziness Lethargy , paraesthesia , somnolence , tremor , syncope
Conjunctivitis , eye pain Uveitis , episcleritis , iritis
Blood creatinine increased , pollakiuria Rash , night sweats , hyperhydrosis , pruritus , erythema
Infections and infestations Vascular disorders General disorders and administration site conditions
Hypersensitivity reactions including rare cases of bronchoconstriction , urticaria and angioedema , and very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/ shock
* Additional adverse events which were reported in the individual studies but were not included due to the pooled presentation are :
Uncommon : dysgeusia , oesophagitis , toothache . Common in Paget s disease only .
For hypocalcaemia , see also text below . ** Based on post-marketing reports .
Since these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product .
Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal dysfunction manifested as deterioration in renal function ( i. e. increased serum creatinine ) and in rare cases acute renal failure .
Renal dysfunction has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid , especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or additional risk factors ( e. g oncology patients with chemotherapy , concomitant nephrotoxic medications , severe dehydration ) , the majority of whom received a 4 mg dose every 3 4 weeks , but it has been observed in patients after a single administration .
In clinical trials in osteoporosis , the change in creatinine clearance ( measured annually prior to dosing ) and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Aclasta and placebo treatment groups over three years .
There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within 10 days in 1.8 % of Aclasta-treated patients versus 0.8 % of placebo-treated patients .
Hypocalcaemia In clinical trials in osteoporosis , approximately 0.2 % of patients had notable declines of serum calcium levels ( less than 1.87 mmol/ l ) following Aclasta administration .
No symptomatic cases of hypocalcaemia were observed .
In the Paget s disease trials , symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1 % of patients , in all of whom it resolved .
Based on laboratory assessment , transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference range ( less than 2.10 mmol/ l ) occurred in 2.3 % of Aclasta-treated patients in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of Aclasta-treated patients in the Paget s disease trials .
The frequency of hypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions .
All patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal osteoporosis trial , the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial , and the Paget s disease trials ( see also section 4.2 ) .
In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip fracture , vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading dose of vitamin D prior to Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
Local reactions In a large clinical trial , local reactions at the infusion site , such as redness , swelling and/ or pain , were reported ( 0.7 % ) following the administration of zoledronic acid .
6 Osteonecrosis of the jaw Uncommonly , cases of osteonecrosis ( primarily of the jaw ) have been reported , predominantly in cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates , including zoledronic acid .
Many of these patients had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental surgeries .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has multiple well documented risk factors including a diagnosis of cancer , concomitant therapies ( e. g. chemotherapy , radiotherapy , corticosteroids ) and co-morbid conditions ( e. g. anaemia , coagulopathies , infection , pre- existing dental disease ) .
Although causality has not been determined , it is prudent to avoid dental surgery as recovery may be prolonged ( see section 4.4 ) .
In a large clinical trial in 7,736 patients , osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with Aclasta and one patient treated with placebo .
There is no experience of acute intoxication with Aclasta .
Patients who have received doses higher than those recommended should be carefully monitored .
In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant hypocalcaemia , reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/ or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate .
Mechanism of action Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone .
It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption .
Pharmacodynamic effects Aclasta treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover from elevated post-menopausal levels with the nadir for resorption markers observed at 7 days , and for formation markers at 12 weeks .
Thereafter bone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range .
There was no progressive reduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated in post-menopausal women ( 7,736 women aged 65 89 years ) with either : a femoral neck bone mineral density ( BMD ) with a T-score 1.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral fracture(s ) ; or a femoral neck BMD T-score 2.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral fracture(s ) .
85 % of patients were bisphosphonate-naïve .
Women who were evaluated for the incidence of vertebral fractures did not receive concomitant osteoporosis therapy , which was allowed for women contributing to the hip and all clinical fracture evaluations .
Concomitant osteoporosis therapy included : calcitonin , raloxifene , tamoxifen , hormone replacement therapy , tibolone ; but excluded other bisphosphonates .
All women received 1,000 to 1,500 mg elemental calcium and 400 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplements daily .
Effect on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta significantly decreased the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures over three years and as early as the one year timepoint ( see Table 2 ) .
Summary of vertebral fracture efficacy at 12 , 24 and 36 months
Aclasta Placebo Absolute reduction in ( % ) ( % ) fracture incidence % ( CI )
reduction in incidence % ( CI )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 1 year )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 2 year )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 3 year ) ** p < 0.0001
Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older exhibited a 60 % reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Effect on hip fractures Aclasta demonstrated a consistent effect over 3 years , resulting in a 41 % reduction in the risk of hip fractures ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
The hip fracture event rate was 1.44 % for Aclasta-treated patients compared to 2.49 % for placebo-treated patients .
The risk reduction was 51 % in bisphosphonate-naïve patients and 42 % in patients allowed to take concomitant osteoporosis therapy .
Effekte auf alle klinischen Frakturen Alle klinischen Frakturen wurden auf der Basis von radiographischen und/oder klinischen Nachweisen verifiziert . A summary of results is presented in Table 3.
Any clinical fracture ( 1 ) Clinical vertebral fracture ( 2 ) Non-vertebral fracture ( 1 ) *p-value < 0.001 , **p-value < 0.0001
( 1 ) Excluding finger , toe and facial fractures ( 2 ) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures
Effect on bone mineral density ( BMD ) Aclasta significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine , hip , and distal radius relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
Treatment with Aclasta resulted in a 6.7 % increase in BMD at the lumbar spine , 6.0 % at the total hip , 5.1 % at the femoral neck , and 3.2 % at the distal radius over 3 years as compared to placebo .
Bone histology Bone biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest 1 year after the third annual dose in 152 post- menopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with Aclasta ( N=82 ) or placebo ( N=70 ) .
Histomorphometric analysis showed a 63 % reduction in bone turnover .
In patients treated with Aclasta , no osteomalacia , marrow fibrosis or woven bone formation was detected .
Tetrazyklin-Markierungen wurden bei allen außer einer von 82 Biopsien gefunden . Microcomputed
8 tomography ( CT ) analysis demonstrated increased trabecular bone volume and preservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo .
Bone turnover markers Bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( BSAP ) , serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen ( P1NP ) and serum beta-C-telopeptides ( b-CTx ) were evaluated in subsets ranging from 517 to 1,246 patients at periodic intervals throughout the study .
Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30 % relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
P1NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 52 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61 % below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 55 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
During this entire time period bone turnover markers were within the pre-menopausal range at the end of each year .
Repeat dosing did not lead to further reduction of bone turnover markers .
Effect on height In the three-year osteoporosis study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer .
The Aclasta group revealed approximately 2.5 mm less height loss compared to placebo ( 95 % CI :
1.6 mm , 3.5 mm ) [ p < 0.0001 ] .
Days of disability Aclasta significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to back pain by 17.9 days and 11.3 days respectively compared to placebo and significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to fractures by 2.9 days and 0.5 days respectively compared to placebo ( all p < 0.01 ) .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at increased risk of fracture after a recent hip fracture ( RFT ) The incidence of clinical fractures , including vertebral , non-vertebral and hip fractures , was evaluated in 2,127 men and women aged 50-95 years ( mean age 74.5 years ) with a recent ( within 90 days ) low- trauma hip fracture who were followed for an average of 2 years on study medication .
Approximately 42 % of patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score below -2.5 and approximately 45 % of the patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score above -2.5 .
Aclasta was administered once a year , until at least 211 patients in the study population had confirmed clinical fractures .
Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125,000 IU orally or via the intramuscular route ) was given to the majority of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion .
All participants received 1,000 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day .
Ninety-five percent of the patients received their infusion two or more weeks after the hip fracture repair and the median timing of infusion was approximately six weeks after the hip fracture repair .
The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of clinical fractures over the duration of the study .
Effect on all clinical fractures The incidence rates of key clinical fracture variables are presented in Table 4.
Between treatment comparisons of the incidence of key clinical fracture variables
Any clinical fracture ( 1 ) Clinical vertebral fracture ( 2 ) Non-vertebral fracture ( 1 ) *p-value < 0.05 , **p-value < 0.01
( 1 ) Excluding finger , toe and facial fractures ( 2 ) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures
The study was not designed to measure significant differences in hip fracture , but a trend was seen towards reduction in new hip fractures .
All cause mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the Aclasta-treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
This corresponds to a 28 % reduction in the risk of all cause mortality ( p=0.01 ) .
The incidence of delayed hip fracture healing was comparable between Aclasta ( 34 [ 3.2 % ] ) and placebo ( 29 [ 2.7 % ] ) .
Effect on bone mineral density ( BMD ) In the HORIZON-RFT study Aclasta treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip and femoral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints .
Treatment with Aclasta resulted in an increase in BMD of 5.4 % at the total hip and 4.3 % at the femoral neck over 24 months as compared to placebo .
Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised into the study and 185 patients had BMD assessed at 24 months .
At 24 months a similar significant increase of 3.6 % in total hip BMD was observed for patients treated with Aclasta as compared to the effects observed in post-menopausal women in the HORIZON-PFT study .
The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men ; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5 % in men treated with Aclasta versus 8.7 % for placebo .
In another study in men ( study CZOL446M2308 ) an annual infusion of Aclasta was non-inferior to weekly alendronate for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 24 relative to baseline .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget s disease of the bone Aclasta was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to moderate Paget s disease of the bone ( median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6 3.0 times the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry ) confirmed by radiographic evidence .
The efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for 2 months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials .
After 6 months , Aclasta showed 96 % ( 169/ 176 ) and 89 % ( 156/ 176 ) response and serum alkaline phosphatase ( SAP ) normalisation rates compared to 74 % ( 127/ 171 ) and 58 % ( 99/ 171 ) for risedronate ( all p < 0.001 ) .
In the pooled results , a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to baseline were observed over 6 months for Aclasta and risedronate .
10 Patients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter an extended follow-up period .
Of the 143 Aclasta-treated patients and 107 risedronate-treated patients who entered an extended observation study , after a median duration of follow-up of 18 months from time of dosing , 141 Aclasta-treated patients maintained their therapeutic response compared to 71 risedronate-treated patients .
This corresponds to a 96 % reduction of risk of relapse in Aclasta versus risedronate-treated patients .
Bone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget s disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg zoledronic acid .
Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired bone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects .
These results were consistent with biochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover .
Single and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data , which were found to be dose independent .
After initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion , plasma concentrations of the active substance increased rapidly , achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period , followed by a rapid decline to < 10 % of peak after 4 hours and < 1 % of peak after 24 hours , with a subsequent prolonged period of very low concentrations not exceeding 0.1 % of peak levels .
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process : rapid biphasic disappearance from the systemic circulation , with half-lives of t½ 0.24 and t½ 1.87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½ 146 hours .
There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days.
The early disposition phases ( and , with t½ values above ) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and excretion via the kidneys .
Zoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney .
Over the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is recovered in the urine , while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue .
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney .
The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/ h , independent of dose , and unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
The inter- and intra-subject variation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36 % and 34 % , respectively .
Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30 % decrease in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve .
No specific drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with zoledronic acid .
Since zoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity as a direct- acting and/ or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes , zoledronic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems .
Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 43-55 % bound ) and binding is concentration independent .
Therefore , interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are unlikely .
Special populations ( see section 4.2 ) The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance , renal clearance representing 75 ± 33 % of the creatinine clearance , which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/ min ( range 22 to 143 ml/ min ) in the 64 patients studied .
Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr ) , by about 30 % to 40 % in mild to moderate renal impairment , compared to a patient with normal renal function , and lack of accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function , suggest that dose adjustments of zoledronic acid in mild ( Clcr = 50 80 ml/ min ) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/ min are not necessary .
As only limited data are available in severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min ) , no dosing recommendations are possible for this population .
Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/ kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/ kg in rats .
In the single-dose dog infusion studies , 1.0 mg/ kg ( 6 fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure based on AUC ) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects .
Subchronic and chronic toxicity In the intravenous infusion studies , renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when given 0.6 mg/ kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals , six times in total ( for a cumulative dose that corresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure ) while five 15-minute infusions of 0.25 mg/ kg administered at 2 3-week intervals ( a cumulative dose that corresponded to 7 times the human therapeutic exposure ) were well tolerated in dogs .
In the intravenous bolus studies , the doses that were well-tolerated decreased with increasing study duration :
0.2 and 0.02 mg/ kg daily was well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs , respectively but only 0.01 mg/ kg and 0.005 mg/ kg in rats and dogs , respectively , when given for 52 weeks .
Longer-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum intended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs , including the gastrointestinal tract and liver , and at the site of intravenous administration .
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown .
The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses , a finding that reflected the compound s pharmacological antiresorptive activity .
Reproduction toxicity Teratology studies were performed in two species , both via subcutaneous administration .
Teratogenicity was observed in rats at doses 0.2 mg/ kg and was manifested by external , visceral and skeletal malformations .
Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose ( 0.01 mg/ kg body weight ) tested in rats .
No teratological or embryo/ foetal effects were observed in rabbits , although maternal toxicity was marked at 0.1 mg/ kg due to decreased serum calcium levels .
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential .

What Aclasta is and what it is used for 2.
WHAT ACLASTA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Aclasta is given as a single infusion into a vein by a doctor or nurse .
It belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women , osteoporosis in men and Paget s disease of the bone .
Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in women after the menopause , but can also occur in men .
At the menopause , a woman s ovaries stop producing the female hormone oestrogen , which helps keep bones healthy .
Following the menopause bone loss occurs , bones become weaker and break more easily .
Many patients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because osteoporosis has made their bones weaker .
Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones , mainly oestrogens converted from androgens , also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men .
In both women and men , Aclasta strengthens the bone and therefore makes it less likely to break .
Because Aclasta works for a long time , you will not need another dose of Aclasta for a year .
Paget s disease of the bone It is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material .
In Paget s disease , bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered fashion , which makes it weaker than normal .
If the disease is not treated , bones may become deformed and painful , and may break .
Aclasta works by returning the bone remodelling process to normal , securing formation of normal bone , thus restoring strength to the bone .
Follow all instructions given to you by your doctor carefully before you are given Aclasta .
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to zoledronic acid , other bisphosphonates or any of the other
- if you have hypocalcaemia ( this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low ) .
- if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant .
26 Take special care with Aclasta Tell your doctor before you are given Aclasta :
- if you are being treated with Zometa , which contains the same active substance as Aclasta .
- if you have a kidney problem , or used to have one .
- if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements .
- if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed .
- if you have had sections of your intestine removed .
- if you had or have pain , swelling or numbness of the jaw or a loosening of the tooth .
If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery , tell your dentist that you are being treated with Aclasta .
Aclasta is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age .
The use of Aclasta in children and adolescents has not been studied .
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor , pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking any medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys .
Using Aclasta with food and drink Make sure you drink enough fluids ( at least one or two glasses ) before and after the treatment with Aclasta , as directed by your doctor .
This will help to prevent dehydration .
You may eat normally on the day you are treated with Aclasta .
Elderly patients ( age 65 years and over ) Aclasta can be given to older patients .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding You should not be given Aclasta if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant .
You should not be given Aclasta if you are breast-feeding .
Ask your doctor , pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine .
Driving and using machines Aclasta has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines .
Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg given as one infusion per year into a vein by your doctor or nurse .
The infusion will take at least 15 minutes .
In case you recently broke your hip , it is recommended that Aclasta is administered two or more weeks after your hip repair surgery .
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse .
It is important to take calcium and vitamin D supplements ( for example tablets ) as directed by your doctor .
For osteoporosis , Aclasta works for one year and you will need the next dose after one year .
27 Paget s disease The usual dose is 5 mg , given to you as one single infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse .
The infusion will take at least 15 minutes .
As Aclasta works for a long time , you may not need another dose of Aclasta for a year or longer .
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse .
Your doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements ( e. g. tablets ) for at least the first ten days after being given Aclasta .
It is important that you follow this advice carefully so that the level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the infusion .
Your doctor will inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia .
For Paget s disease Aclasta may work for longer than one year , and your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated again .
If a dose of Aclasta is missed Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment .
Before stopping Aclasta therapy If you are considering stopping Aclasta treatment , please go to your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Aclasta .
If you have any questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor , pharmacist or nurse .
Like all medicines , Aclasta can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
In most cases , no specific treatment is required .
Side effects related to the first infusion are very common ( occurring in more than 30 % of patients ) but are less common following subsequent infusions .
The majority of the side effects , such as fever and chills , pain in the muscles or joints , and headache , occur within the first three days following the dose of Aclasta .
The symptoms are usually mild to moderate and go away within three days.
Your doctor can recommend a mild pain reliever such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to reduce these side effects .
The chance of experiencing these side effects decreases with subsequent doses of Aclasta .
Irregular heart rhythm ( atrial fibrillation ) has been seen in patients receiving Aclasta for post- menopausal osteoporosis .
It is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have received Aclasta .
Very common side effects ( affecting 10 or more in every 100 patients ) :
Common side effects ( affecting less than 10 in every 100 patients ) :
Fever and chills , headache , feeling sick , pain in your muscles , pain in your bones and/ or joints , tiredness , weakness , dizziness , vomiting , pain in your back , arms or legs .
In patients with Paget s disease : symptoms due to low blood calcium , such as muscle spasms , or numbness , or a tingling sensation especially in the area around the mouth .
Uncommon side effects ( affecting less than 1 in every 100 patients ) :
Flu , sleeplessness , tiredness , feeling of pins and needles or tingling sensation , drowsiness , tremor , temporary loss of consciousness , taste disturbance , diarrhoea , indigestion , abdominal pain , dry mouth , inflammation of oesophagus , toothache , joint pain , joint swelling , stiffness , eating disorder , redness , itching and pain in the eyes , chest pain , increased blood pressure , flushing , shortness of breath , rash ,
Rare side effects ( affecting less than 1 in every 1,000 patients ) :
Skin reactions such as redness , swelling and/ or pain at the infusion site may occur .
Bisphosphonates ( the group of substances Aclasta belongs to ) may cause swelling , redness , pain and itching of the eyes or eye sensitivity to light .
Persistent pain and/ or non-healing sores of the mouth or jaw have been reported primarily in patients treated with bisphosphonates for other illnesses .
If you experience these symptoms , tell your doctor or dentist .
Allergic reactions have been reported including rare cases of difficulty breathing , hives and angioedema ( such as swollen face , tongue or throat ) .
There have been isolated reports of very serious allergic reactions .
If you notice any of these side effects , tell your doctor .
If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , pharmacist or nurse .

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only :
The dose of 5 mg of zoledronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minutes .
Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min ) due to lack of adequate clinical experience in this population .
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to and following administration of Aclasta ; this is especially important for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) .
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta .
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated ( e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve , intestinal calcium malabsorption ) .
Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients .
Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget s disease of the bone .
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover , transient hypocalcaemia , sometimes symptomatic , may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta .
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget 's disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration .
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk .
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion .
- Aclasta 5 mg solution for infusion is ready for use .
Any unused solution should be discarded .
Only clear solution free from particles and discoloration should be used .
Aclasta must not be mixed or given intravenously with any other medication and must be given through a separate vented infusion line at a constant infusion rate .
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes .
Aclasta must not be allowed to come into contact with any calcium-containing solutions .
If refrigerated , allow the refrigerated solution to reach room temperature before administration .
Aseptic techniques must be followed during preparation of the infusion .
The infusion must be conducted according to standard medical practice .
- Keep Aclasta out of the reach and sight of children .
- Do not use Aclasta after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle .
- The unopened bottle does not require any special storage conditions .
- After opening the bottle , the product should be used immediately in order to avoid microbial
If not used immediately , in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C .
Allow the refrigerated solution to reach room temperature before administration .
Each bottle with 100 ml of solution contains 5 mg zoledronic acid anhydrous , corresponding to 5.330 mg zoledronic acid monohydrate .
One ml solution contains 0.05 mg zoledronic acid anhydrous , corresponding to 0.0533 mg zoledronic acid monohydrate .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women in men at increased risk of fracture , including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture .
Treatment of Paget s disease of the bone .
For the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men , the recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta administered once a year .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair ( see section 5.1 ) .
For the treatment of Paget s disease , Aclasta should be prescribed only by physicians with experience in treatment of Paget s disease of the bone .
The recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta .
Retreatment of Paget s disease : specific retreatment data are not available .
After a single treatment with Aclasta in Paget s disease , an extended remission period is observed in responding patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
Aclasta ( 5 mg in 100 ml ready-to-infuse solution ) is administered via a vented infusion line and given at a constant infusion rate .
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes .
For information on the infusion of Aclasta , see section 6.6 .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta .
This is especially important for the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
2 Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget s disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.4 ) .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion .
The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration .
Patients with renal impairment ( see section 4.4 ) Use of Aclasta in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min is not recommended due to limited clinical experience in this population .
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance 35 ml/ min .
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required ( see section 5.2 ) .
Elderly patients ( 65 years ) No dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability , distribution and elimination were similar in elderly patients and younger subjects .
Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates .
Aclasta is contraindicated for patients with hypocalcaemia ( see section 4.4 ) .
Aclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women ( see section 4.6 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minutes .
Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min ) due to limited clinical experience in this population .
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta .
This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) , see section 4.5 .
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta ( see section 4.3 ) .
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated ( e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve , intestinal calcium malabsorption ) .
Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients .
3 Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget s disease of the bone .
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover , transient hypocalcaemia , sometimes symptomatic , may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta ( see section 4.8 ) .
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget 's disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk .
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease .
Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone , joint and/ or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates , including Aclasta .
Aclasta contains the same active substance found in Zometa ( zoledronic acid ) , used for oncology indications , and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with Aclasta .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported predominantly in patients with cancer receiving treatment regimens including bisphosphonates , including zoledronic acid .
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids .
The majority of reported cases have been associated with dental procedures such as tooth extraction .
Many had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis .
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors ( e. g. cancer , chemotherapy , corticosteroids , poor oral hygiene ) .
While on treatment , these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible .
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy , dental surgery may exacerbate the condition .
For patients requiring dental procedures , there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw .
The clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Specific drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with zoledronic acid .
Zoledronic acid is not systemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro ( see section 5.2 ) .
Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 43-55 % bound ) and interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are therefore unlikely .
Zoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) .
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women .
Studies in animals with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicological effects including malformations ( see section 5.3 ) .
The potential risk for humans is unknown .
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human breast milk .
Aclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women ( see section 4.3 ) .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
The overall percentage of patients who experienced post-dose symptoms were 44.7 % , 16.7 % and 10.2 % after the first , second and third infusion , respectively .
Incidence of individual symptoms following the first infusion was : fever ( 17.1 % ) , myalgia ( 7.8 % ) , flu-like symptoms ( 6.7 % ) , arthralgia ( 4.8 % ) and headache ( 5.1 % ) .
The incidence of these symptoms decreased markedly with subsequent doses of Aclasta .
The majority of these symptoms occur within the first three days following Aclasta administration .
The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate and resolved within three days of the event onset .
The percentage of patients who experienced post-dose symptoms was lower in a smaller study ( 19.5 % , 10.4 % , 10.7 % after the first , second and third infusion , respectively ) , where prophylaxis against post-dose symptoms was used as described below .
The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
In the HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial [ PFT ] ( see section 5.1 ) , the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5 % ( 96 out of 3,862 ) and 1.9 % ( 75 out of 3,852 ) in patients receiving Aclasta and placebo , respectively .
The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Aclasta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 out of 3,862 ) compared with patients receiving placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 out of 3,852 ) .
The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is unknown .
In the osteoporosis trials ( PFT , HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [ RFT ] ) the pooled atrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between Aclasta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
For atrial fibrillation serious adverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3 % for Aclasta and 0.8 % for placebo .
Very common ( 1/ 10 ) , common ( 1/ 100 , < 1/ 10 ) , uncommon ( 1/ 1,000 , < 1/ 100 ) , rare ( 1/ 10,000 , < 1/ 1,000 ) adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 1.
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Blood pressure increased Atrial fibrillation Headache , dizziness Lethargy , paraesthesia , somnolence , tremor , syncope
Conjunctivitis , eye pain Uveitis , episcleritis , iritis
Blood creatinine increased , pollakiuria Rash , night sweats , hyperhydrosis , pruritus , erythema
Infections and infestations Vascular disorders General disorders and administration site conditions
Hypersensitivity reactions including rare cases of bronchoconstriction , urticaria and angioedema , and very rare cases of anaphylactic reaction/ shock
* Additional adverse events which were reported in the individual studies but were not included due to the pooled presentation are :
Uncommon : dysgeusia , oesophagitis , toothache . Common in Paget s disease only .
For hypocalcaemia , see also text below . ** Based on post-marketing reports .
Since these reports are from a population of uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to exposure to the medicinal product .
Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal dysfunction manifested as deterioration in renal function ( i. e. increased serum creatinine ) and in rare cases acute renal failure .
Renal dysfunction has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid , especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or additional risk factors ( e. g oncology patients with chemotherapy , concomitant nephrotoxic medications , severe dehydration ) , the majority of whom received a 4 mg dose every 3 4 weeks , but it has been observed in patients after a single administration .
In clinical trials in osteoporosis , the change in creatinine clearance ( measured annually prior to dosing ) and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Aclasta and placebo treatment groups over three years .
There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within 10 days in 1.8 % of Aclasta-treated patients versus 0.8 % of placebo-treated patients .
Hypocalcaemia In clinical trials in osteoporosis , approximately 0.2 % of patients had notable declines of serum calcium levels ( less than 1.87 mmol/ l ) following Aclasta administration .
No symptomatic cases of hypocalcaemia were observed .
In the Paget s disease trials , symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1 % of patients , in all of whom it resolved .
Based on laboratory assessment , transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference range ( less than 2.10 mmol/ l ) occurred in 2.3 % of Aclasta-treated patients in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of Aclasta-treated patients in the Paget s disease trials .
The frequency of hypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions .
All patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal osteoporosis trial , the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial , and the Paget s disease trials ( see also section 4.2 ) .
In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip fracture , vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading dose of vitamin D prior to Aclasta administration ( see section 4.2 ) .
Local reactions In a large clinical trial , local reactions at the infusion site , such as redness , swelling and/ or pain , were reported ( 0.7 % ) following the administration of zoledronic acid .
6 Osteonecrosis of the jaw Uncommonly , cases of osteonecrosis ( primarily of the jaw ) have been reported , predominantly in cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates , including zoledronic acid .
Many of these patients had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental surgeries .
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has multiple well documented risk factors including a diagnosis of cancer , concomitant therapies ( e. g. chemotherapy , radiotherapy , corticosteroids ) and co-morbid conditions ( e. g. anaemia , coagulopathies , infection , pre- existing dental disease ) .
Although causality has not been determined , it is prudent to avoid dental surgery as recovery may be prolonged ( see section 4.4 ) .
In a large clinical trial in 7,736 patients , osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with Aclasta and one patient treated with placebo .
There is no experience of acute intoxication with Aclasta .
Patients who have received doses higher than those recommended should be carefully monitored .
In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant hypocalcaemia , reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/ or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate .
Mechanism of action Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone .
It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption .
Pharmacodynamic effects Aclasta treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover from elevated post-menopausal levels with the nadir for resorption markers observed at 7 days , and for formation markers at 12 weeks .
Thereafter bone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range .
There was no progressive reduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated in post-menopausal women ( 7,736 women aged 65 89 years ) with either : a femoral neck bone mineral density ( BMD ) with a T-score 1.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral fracture(s ) ; or a femoral neck BMD T-score 2.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral fracture(s ) .
85 % of patients were bisphosphonate-naïve .
Women who were evaluated for the incidence of vertebral fractures did not receive concomitant osteoporosis therapy , which was allowed for women contributing to the hip and all clinical fracture evaluations .
Concomitant osteoporosis therapy included : calcitonin , raloxifene , tamoxifen , hormone replacement therapy , tibolone ; but excluded other bisphosphonates .
All women received 1,000 to 1,500 mg elemental calcium and 400 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplements daily .
Effect on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta significantly decreased the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures over three years and as early as the one year timepoint ( see Table 2 ) .
Summary of vertebral fracture efficacy at 12 , 24 and 36 months
Aclasta Placebo Absolute reduction in ( % ) ( % ) fracture incidence % ( CI )
reduction in incidence % ( CI )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 1 year )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 2 year )
At least one new vertebral fracture ( 0 3 year ) ** p < 0.0001
Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older exhibited a 60 % reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients ( p < 0.0001 ) .
Effect on hip fractures Aclasta demonstrated a consistent effect over 3 years , resulting in a 41 % reduction in the risk of hip fractures ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
The hip fracture event rate was 1.44 % for Aclasta-treated patients compared to 2.49 % for placebo-treated patients .
The risk reduction was 51 % in bisphosphonate-naïve patients and 42 % in patients allowed to take concomitant osteoporosis therapy .
Effekte auf alle klinischen Frakturen Alle klinischen Frakturen wurden auf der Basis von radiographischen und/oder klinischen Nachweisen verifiziert . A summary of results is presented in Table 3.
Any clinical fracture ( 1 ) Clinical vertebral fracture ( 2 ) Non-vertebral fracture ( 1 ) *p-value < 0.001 , **p-value < 0.0001
( 1 ) Excluding finger , toe and facial fractures ( 2 ) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures
Effect on bone mineral density ( BMD ) Aclasta significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine , hip , and distal radius relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
Treatment with Aclasta resulted in a 6.7 % increase in BMD at the lumbar spine , 6.0 % at the total hip , 5.1 % at the femoral neck , and 3.2 % at the distal radius over 3 years as compared to placebo .
Bone histology Bone biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest 1 year after the third annual dose in 152 post- menopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with Aclasta ( N=82 ) or placebo ( N=70 ) .
Histomorphometric analysis showed a 63 % reduction in bone turnover .
In patients treated with Aclasta , no osteomalacia , marrow fibrosis or woven bone formation was detected .
Tetrazyklin-Markierungen wurden bei allen außer einer von 82 Biopsien gefunden . Microcomputed
8 tomography ( CT ) analysis demonstrated increased trabecular bone volume and preservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo .
Bone turnover markers Bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( BSAP ) , serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen ( P1NP ) and serum beta-C-telopeptides ( b-CTx ) were evaluated in subsets ranging from 517 to 1,246 patients at periodic intervals throughout the study .
Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30 % relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
P1NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 52 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61 % below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 55 % below baseline levels at 36 months .
During this entire time period bone turnover markers were within the pre-menopausal range at the end of each year .
Repeat dosing did not lead to further reduction of bone turnover markers .
Effect on height In the three-year osteoporosis study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer .
The Aclasta group revealed approximately 2.5 mm less height loss compared to placebo ( 95 % CI :
1.6 mm , 3.5 mm ) [ p < 0.0001 ] .
Days of disability Aclasta significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to back pain by 17.9 days and 11.3 days respectively compared to placebo and significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to fractures by 2.9 days and 0.5 days respectively compared to placebo ( all p < 0.01 ) .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at increased risk of fracture after a recent hip fracture ( RFT ) The incidence of clinical fractures , including vertebral , non-vertebral and hip fractures , was evaluated in 2,127 men and women aged 50-95 years ( mean age 74.5 years ) with a recent ( within 90 days ) low- trauma hip fracture who were followed for an average of 2 years on study medication .
Approximately 42 % of patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score below -2.5 and approximately 45 % of the patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score above -2.5 .
Aclasta was administered once a year , until at least 211 patients in the study population had confirmed clinical fractures .
Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125,000 IU orally or via the intramuscular route ) was given to the majority of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion .
All participants received 1,000 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day .
Ninety-five percent of the patients received their infusion two or more weeks after the hip fracture repair and the median timing of infusion was approximately six weeks after the hip fracture repair .
The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of clinical fractures over the duration of the study .
Effect on all clinical fractures The incidence rates of key clinical fracture variables are presented in Table 4.
Between treatment comparisons of the incidence of key clinical fracture variables
Any clinical fracture ( 1 ) Clinical vertebral fracture ( 2 ) Non-vertebral fracture ( 1 ) *p-value < 0.05 , **p-value < 0.01
( 1 ) Excluding finger , toe and facial fractures ( 2 ) Including clinical thoracic and clinical lumbar vertebral fractures
The study was not designed to measure significant differences in hip fracture , but a trend was seen towards reduction in new hip fractures .
All cause mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the Aclasta-treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
This corresponds to a 28 % reduction in the risk of all cause mortality ( p=0.01 ) .
The incidence of delayed hip fracture healing was comparable between Aclasta ( 34 [ 3.2 % ] ) and placebo ( 29 [ 2.7 % ] ) .
Effect on bone mineral density ( BMD ) In the HORIZON-RFT study Aclasta treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip and femoral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints .
Treatment with Aclasta resulted in an increase in BMD of 5.4 % at the total hip and 4.3 % at the femoral neck over 24 months as compared to placebo .
Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised into the study and 185 patients had BMD assessed at 24 months .
At 24 months a similar significant increase of 3.6 % in total hip BMD was observed for patients treated with Aclasta as compared to the effects observed in post-menopausal women in the HORIZON-PFT study .
The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men ; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5 % in men treated with Aclasta versus 8.7 % for placebo .
In another study in men ( study CZOL446M2308 ) an annual infusion of Aclasta was non-inferior to weekly alendronate for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 24 relative to baseline .
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget s disease of the bone Aclasta was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to moderate Paget s disease of the bone ( median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6 3.0 times the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry ) confirmed by radiographic evidence .
The efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for 2 months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials .
After 6 months , Aclasta showed 96 % ( 169/ 176 ) and 89 % ( 156/ 176 ) response and serum alkaline phosphatase ( SAP ) normalisation rates compared to 74 % ( 127/ 171 ) and 58 % ( 99/ 171 ) for risedronate ( all p < 0.001 ) .
In the pooled results , a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to baseline were observed over 6 months for Aclasta and risedronate .
10 Patients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter an extended follow-up period .
Of the 143 Aclasta-treated patients and 107 risedronate-treated patients who entered an extended observation study , after a median duration of follow-up of 18 months from time of dosing , 141 Aclasta-treated patients maintained their therapeutic response compared to 71 risedronate-treated patients .
This corresponds to a 96 % reduction of risk of relapse in Aclasta versus risedronate-treated patients .
Bone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget s disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg zoledronic acid .
Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired bone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects .
These results were consistent with biochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover .
Single and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data , which were found to be dose independent .
After initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion , plasma concentrations of the active substance increased rapidly , achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period , followed by a rapid decline to < 10 % of peak after 4 hours and < 1 % of peak after 24 hours , with a subsequent prolonged period of very low concentrations not exceeding 0.1 % of peak levels .
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process : rapid biphasic disappearance from the systemic circulation , with half-lives of t½ 0.24 and t½ 1.87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½ 146 hours .
There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days.
The early disposition phases ( and , with t½ values above ) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and excretion via the kidneys .
Zoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney .
Over the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is recovered in the urine , while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue .
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney .
The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/ h , independent of dose , and unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
The inter- and intra-subject variation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36 % and 34 % , respectively .
Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30 % decrease in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion , but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve .
No specific drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with zoledronic acid .
Since zoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity as a direct- acting and/ or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes , zoledronic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems .
Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 43-55 % bound ) and binding is concentration independent .
Therefore , interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are unlikely .
Special populations ( see section 4.2 ) The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance , renal clearance representing 75 ± 33 % of the creatinine clearance , which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/ min ( range 22 to 143 ml/ min ) in the 64 patients studied .
Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr ) , by about 30 % to 40 % in mild to moderate renal impairment , compared to a patient with normal renal function , and lack of accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function , suggest that dose adjustments of zoledronic acid in mild ( Clcr = 50 80 ml/ min ) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/ min are not necessary .
As only limited data are available in severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min ) , no dosing recommendations are possible for this population .
Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/ kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/ kg in rats .
In the single-dose dog infusion studies , 1.0 mg/ kg ( 6 fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure based on AUC ) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects .
Subchronic and chronic toxicity In the intravenous infusion studies , renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when given 0.6 mg/ kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals , six times in total ( for a cumulative dose that corresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure ) while five 15-minute infusions of 0.25 mg/ kg administered at 2 3-week intervals ( a cumulative dose that corresponded to 7 times the human therapeutic exposure ) were well tolerated in dogs .
In the intravenous bolus studies , the doses that were well-tolerated decreased with increasing study duration :
0.2 and 0.02 mg/ kg daily was well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs , respectively but only 0.01 mg/ kg and 0.005 mg/ kg in rats and dogs , respectively , when given for 52 weeks .
Longer-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum intended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs , including the gastrointestinal tract and liver , and at the site of intravenous administration .
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown .
The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses , a finding that reflected the compound s pharmacological antiresorptive activity .
Reproduction toxicity Teratology studies were performed in two species , both via subcutaneous administration .
Teratogenicity was observed in rats at doses 0.2 mg/ kg and was manifested by external , visceral and skeletal malformations .
Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose ( 0.01 mg/ kg body weight ) tested in rats .
No teratological or embryo/ foetal effects were observed in rabbits , although maternal toxicity was marked at 0.1 mg/ kg due to decreased serum calcium levels .
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential .

What Aclasta is and what it is used for 2.
WHAT ACLASTA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Aclasta is given as a single infusion into a vein by a doctor or nurse .
It belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women , osteoporosis in men and Paget s disease of the bone .
Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in women after the menopause , but can also occur in men .
At the menopause , a woman s ovaries stop producing the female hormone oestrogen , which helps keep bones healthy .
Following the menopause bone loss occurs , bones become weaker and break more easily .
Many patients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because osteoporosis has made their bones weaker .
Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones , mainly oestrogens converted from androgens , also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men .
In both women and men , Aclasta strengthens the bone and therefore makes it less likely to break .
Because Aclasta works for a long time , you will not need another dose of Aclasta for a year .
Paget s disease of the bone It is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material .
In Paget s disease , bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered fashion , which makes it weaker than normal .
If the disease is not treated , bones may become deformed and painful , and may break .
Aclasta works by returning the bone remodelling process to normal , securing formation of normal bone , thus restoring strength to the bone .
Follow all instructions given to you by your doctor carefully before you are given Aclasta .
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to zoledronic acid , other bisphosphonates or any of the other
- if you have hypocalcaemia ( this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low ) .
- if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant .
26 Take special care with Aclasta Tell your doctor before you are given Aclasta :
- if you are being treated with Zometa , which contains the same active substance as Aclasta .
- if you have a kidney problem , or used to have one .
- if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements .
- if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed .
- if you have had sections of your intestine removed .
- if you had or have pain , swelling or numbness of the jaw or a loosening of the tooth .
If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery , tell your dentist that you are being treated with Aclasta .
Aclasta is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age .
The use of Aclasta in children and adolescents has not been studied .
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor , pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking any medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys .
Using Aclasta with food and drink Make sure you drink enough fluids ( at least one or two glasses ) before and after the treatment with Aclasta , as directed by your doctor .
This will help to prevent dehydration .
You may eat normally on the day you are treated with Aclasta .
Elderly patients ( age 65 years and over ) Aclasta can be given to older patients .
Pregnancy and breast-feeding You should not be given Aclasta if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant .
You should not be given Aclasta if you are breast-feeding .
Ask your doctor , pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine .
Driving and using machines Aclasta has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines .
Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg given as one infusion per year into a vein by your doctor or nurse .
The infusion will take at least 15 minutes .
In case you recently broke your hip , it is recommended that Aclasta is administered two or more weeks after your hip repair surgery .
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse .
It is important to take calcium and vitamin D supplements ( for example tablets ) as directed by your doctor .
For osteoporosis , Aclasta works for one year and you will need the next dose after one year .
27 Paget s disease The usual dose is 5 mg , given to you as one single infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse .
The infusion will take at least 15 minutes .
As Aclasta works for a long time , you may not need another dose of Aclasta for a year or longer .
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse .
Your doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements ( e. g. tablets ) for at least the first ten days after being given Aclasta .
It is important that you follow this advice carefully so that the level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the infusion .
Your doctor will inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia .
For Paget s disease Aclasta may work for longer than one year , and your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated again .
If a dose of Aclasta is missed Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment .
Before stopping Aclasta therapy If you are considering stopping Aclasta treatment , please go to your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Aclasta .
If you have any questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor , pharmacist or nurse .
Like all medicines , Aclasta can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
In most cases , no specific treatment is required .
Side effects related to the first infusion are very common ( occurring in more than 30 % of patients ) but are less common following subsequent infusions .
The majority of the side effects , such as fever and chills , pain in the muscles or joints , and headache , occur within the first three days following the dose of Aclasta .
The symptoms are usually mild to moderate and go away within three days.
Your doctor can recommend a mild pain reliever such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to reduce these side effects .
The chance of experiencing these side effects decreases with subsequent doses of Aclasta .
Irregular heart rhythm ( atrial fibrillation ) has been seen in patients receiving Aclasta for post- menopausal osteoporosis .
It is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have received Aclasta .
Very common side effects ( affecting 10 or more in every 100 patients ) :
Common side effects ( affecting less than 10 in every 100 patients ) :
Fever and chills , headache , feeling sick , pain in your muscles , pain in your bones and/ or joints , tiredness , weakness , dizziness , vomiting , pain in your back , arms or legs .
In patients with Paget s disease : symptoms due to low blood calcium , such as muscle spasms , or numbness , or a tingling sensation especially in the area around the mouth .
Uncommon side effects ( affecting less than 1 in every 100 patients ) :
Flu , sleeplessness , tiredness , feeling of pins and needles or tingling sensation , drowsiness , tremor , temporary loss of consciousness , taste disturbance , diarrhoea , indigestion , abdominal pain , dry mouth , inflammation of oesophagus , toothache , joint pain , joint swelling , stiffness , eating disorder , redness , itching and pain in the eyes , chest pain , increased blood pressure , flushing , shortness of breath , rash ,
Rare side effects ( affecting less than 1 in every 1,000 patients ) :
Skin reactions such as redness , swelling and/ or pain at the infusion site may occur .
Bisphosphonates ( the group of substances Aclasta belongs to ) may cause swelling , redness , pain and itching of the eyes or eye sensitivity to light .
Persistent pain and/ or non-healing sores of the mouth or jaw have been reported primarily in patients treated with bisphosphonates for other illnesses .
If you experience these symptoms , tell your doctor or dentist .
Allergic reactions have been reported including rare cases of difficulty breathing , hives and angioedema ( such as swollen face , tongue or throat ) .
There have been isolated reports of very serious allergic reactions .
If you notice any of these side effects , tell your doctor .
If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , pharmacist or nurse .

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only :
The dose of 5 mg of zoledronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minutes .
Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min ) due to lack of adequate clinical experience in this population .
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair .
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to and following administration of Aclasta ; this is especially important for patients receiving diuretic therapy .
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function ( e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration ) .
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta .
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated ( e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve , intestinal calcium malabsorption ) .
Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients .
Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget s disease of the bone .
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover , transient hypocalcaemia , sometimes symptomatic , may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta .
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration .
In addition , in patients with Paget 's disease , it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration .
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk .
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease .
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture , a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion .
- Aclasta 5 mg solution for infusion is ready for use .
Any unused solution should be discarded .
Only clear solution free from particles and discoloration should be used .
Aclasta must not be mixed or given intravenously with any other medication and must be given through a separate vented infusion line at a constant infusion rate .
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes .
Aclasta must not be allowed to come into contact with any calcium-containing solutions .
If refrigerated , allow the refrigerated solution to reach room temperature before administration .
Aseptic techniques must be followed during preparation of the infusion .
The infusion must be conducted according to standard medical practice .
