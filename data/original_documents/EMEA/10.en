Solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe ( injection )
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
4 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
5 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
6 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
8 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
9 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
11 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
18 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
19 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
20 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
22 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
23 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
25 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
26 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
32 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
33 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
34 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
36 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
37 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
39 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
40 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
46 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
47 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
48 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
50 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
51 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
53 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
54 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
60 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
61 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
62 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
64 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
65 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
67 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
68 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
74 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
75 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
76 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
78 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
79 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
81 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
82 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
88 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
89 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
90 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
92 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
93 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
95 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
96 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
102 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
103 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
104 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
106 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
107 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
109 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
110 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
116 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
117 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
118 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
120 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
121 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
123 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
124 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
130 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
131 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
132 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
134 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
135 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
137 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
138 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

What Abseamed is and what it is used for 2.
WHAT ABSEAMED IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Abseamed contains a hormone called epoetin alfa , which stimulates the production of red blood cells .
Epoetin alfa is produced by a specialised genetic technology and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin .
Abseamed is used : for treating symptomatic anaemia associated with kidney disease ( given by injection into a vein ) in children and adults on dialysis in adults on peritoneal dialysis for treating severe symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease in adults not yet undergoing dialysis ( given by injection into a vein ) for treating anaemia and reducing the need for a blood transfusion in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the doctor in moderately anaemic patients who are going to have surgery and prior to it , donate blood so that their own blood can be given to them during or after surgery ( autologous predonation ) as an alternative to a blood transfusion in adult patients about to undergo major orthopaedic ( bone ) surgery where there is a potentially high risk from blood transfusion complications
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of Abseamed
- if you have developed Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( reduced or stopped production of red blood cells )
- if you have high blood pressure which is not properly controlled
- if you are donating your own blood before surgery , and :
you had a heart attack or stroke in the month before your treatment you have unstable angina pectoris ( new or increasing chest pain ) you are at risk of blood clots in the veins ( deep venous thrombosis ) for example , if you have had clots before
- if you cannot receive adequate treatment for the prevention of blood clots ( antithrombotic
- if you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery and :
you have severe disorders of blood circulation of the heart ( coronary heart disease ) , arteries of the legs or arms ( peripheral arterial occlusive disease ) , neck vessels ( vascular disease of the carotids ) or the brain ( cerebrovascular disease ) you had a recent heart attack or stroke
If any of these applies to you , or might apply , tell your doctor at once .
In all patients treated with Abseamed blood pressure should be closely monitored and treated , if necessary .
Abseamed should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated or poorly controllable hypertension .
It may be necessary to initiate or increase treatment against high blood pressure .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , Abseamed treatment should be discontinued .
Take special care with Abseamed if you have epilepsy or chronic liver disease .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent increase in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with Abseamed , which gradually regresses during the course of continued therapy .
Your doctor may do regular blood tests to check your blood platelet count during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia , e. g. iron deficiency , damage of red blood cells ( haemolysis ) , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be taken into account and treated prior to initiating therapy with Abseamed .
In order to ensure optimum response to Abseamed adequate iron stores should be ensured .
Your doctor may do blood tests to decide , if you need iron supplements .
Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of subcutaneous ( injection under the skin ) erythropoietin treatment .
PRCA means the inability to produce enough red blood cells in the bone marrow .
PRCA can result in sudden and severe anaemia , the symptoms of which are unusual tiredness , feeling dizzy or breathlessness .
If you experience these symptoms you should talk to your doctor at once .
Your doctor can decide whether Abseamed is not working properly for you .
If you develop PRCA your Abseamed therapy will be discontinued and your doctor will decide how best to treat your anaemia .
There is not much experience with subcutaneous use ( injection into the skin ) of Abseamed in kidney patients .
Therefore , if you are being treated for anaemia associated with kidney disease , Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein ( intravenously ) .
Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) regularly
- to ensure that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level as high haemoglobin could put
you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of death
- to minimise the risk of an increase in blood pressure .
Increased levels of potassium ( hyperkalaemia ) have been observed in isolated cases .
The correction of your anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and thus increased potassium and protein intake .
Therefore dialysis procedures may have to be adjusted to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
If an elevated or increasing serum potassium level is detected , your doctor may consider to discontinue the treatment with Abseamed until the potassium level has returned to the normal range .
An increase in dose of a particular blood-thinning medicine ( heparin ) during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with Abseamed .
Inadequate thinning of the blood by heparin ( heparinisation ) may lead to occlusion of the dialysis system .
If you have chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or signs of congestion due to inadequate heart output , your doctor will make sure that your haemoglobin levels do not exceed a certain level .
Based on information available to date , treatment of anaemia with Abseamed in adult patients with chronic kidney failure ( renal insufficiency ) who do not yet require dialysis , does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
The 2-3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of desired effects should be taken into account when assessing the efficacy of Abseamed .
Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) regularly and adjust your dose of Abseamed accordingly to minimise the risk of blood clotting ( thrombotic events ) .
Cancer patients receiving treatment with erythropoietin have an increased risk of blood clots/ blood clotting disorders ( thrombotic vascular events ) .
This risk should be carefully weighted against the benefit to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa , particularly if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , e. g. if you are obese or have a history of thrombotic vascular events ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Abseamed may act as a blood cell growth factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer .
Depending on your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable .
Please discuss this with your doctor .
Patients donating their own blood before surgery
Your doctor will consider warnings and precautions associated with autologous blood predonation , especially volume replacement .
If you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery , the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of Abseamed treatment .
Blood clots ( thrombotic events ) can be a
Ihr Arzt wird dieses Risiko sorgfältig gegenüber den aus der Behandlung mit Epoetin alfa abgeleiteten Vorteilen abwägen . Your doctor will weight this risk carefully against the benefits to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa .
You should receive adequate measures in order to prevent blood clots ( thrombotic prophylaxis ) , particularly if you have cardiovascular disorders .
If your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) are too high you should not receive Abseamed , since you have an increased risk of blood clotting after the surgery .
If you are a cancer patient be aware that erythropoietins may act as growth factor .
Please discuss this with your doctor .
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
If you are taking cyclosporin ( medicine to suppress your immune system ) during therapy with Abseamed , your doctor may order special blood tests to measure cyclosporin levels .
Laboratory tests did not show an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF ( G-CSF and GM-CSF are medicines to stimulate the immune-system e. g. when receiving a chemotherapy for cancer or in case of HIV ) .
There is not much experience with Abseamed in pregnant women or women who are breast-feeding .
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
No effects on ability to drive or use machines have been observed .

Instructions for injecting Abseamed under the skin
If you are a kidney patient Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein .
Do not give by injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
The amount injected in any one place should not normally exceed one mililitre ( 1 ml ) .
The injections are given preferably in the thigh or the front part of the abdominal wall .
At the start of your therapy , Abseamed may be injected by medical staff .
However , your doctor may decide that it is right for you to learn how to inject Abseamed under the skin yourself .
You will receive appropriate training for you to do this .
Under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself unless you have been trained to do so .
Remove one syringe from the pack and remove the protective cap from the injection needle .
Clean the skin at the injection site using an alcohol wipe .
Form a skin fold by pinching the skin between thumb and forefinger .
Insert the needle into the skin fold with a quick , firm action .
Ensure that you only inject the amount as instructed by your doctor or nurse .
Withdraw the needle quickly and apply pressure over the injection site with a dry , sterile pad .
Only use each syringe for one injection .
If you inject more Abseamed than you should
You should inform the doctor immediately if you think too much Abseamed has been injected .
If you have missed an injection , or injected too little , talk to your doctor .
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose .
If you have any further questions on the use of this product , ask your doctor or pharmacist .
Like all medicines , Abseamed can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
If you experience headaches , particularly sudden , stabbing migraine-like headaches or feel confused or have fits , tell your doctor immediately .
These may be the warning signs of a sudden rise in blood pressure which requires urgent treatment .
- flu-like symptoms , such as headache , aches and pains in the joints , feeling of weakness ,
These may be more common at the start of treatment .
- An increase in levels of blood platelets ( thrombocytes ) which are normally involved in the
formation of a blood clot may occur .
- Thrombotic events ( blood clotting ) in blood vessels , such as disturbed blood perfusion of the
heart , heart attack , cerebral haemorrhages , stroke , temporary disturbance of blood perfusion in the brain , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , dilatation of the wall of a blood vessel ( aneurysm ) , retinal thrombosis , and blood clot in an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietin treatment .
- Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in rare cases , including swelling , mainly in the
region of the eyelids and the lips ( Quincke 's oedema ) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms of tingling , reddening , itching , hot flush and accelerated pulse .
- Pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of
subcutaneous ( injection under the skin ) erythropoietin treatment .
PRCA means the inability to produce enough red blood cells in the bone ( see section Take special care with Abseamed ) .
- raised blood pressure which may require treatment with medicinal products or adjustment of the
dosage of medicinal products you already take for high blood pressure .
Your doctor may monitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Abseamed , particularly at the start of therapy .
- Occlusion in the connection between artery and vein ( shunt thrombosis ) may occur especially if
you have low blood pressure or if your arteriovenous fistula has complications .
Your doctor may check your shunt and prescribe a medicinal product to prevent thrombosis .
- blood clotting ( thrombotic vascular events ) ( see section Take special care with Abseamed ) .
Therefore your haemoglobin-levels and your blood pressure should
Patients donating their own blood before surgery
with underlying cardiovascular disease : after donating blood repeatedly vascular and thrombotic events ( blood clotting ) can occur independently of treatment with Abseamed .
Therefore your doctor may prescribe a medicinal product for volume replacement ( infusion ) .
Treatment with Abseamed may be associated with an increased risk of blood clotting after the surgery ( postoperative thrombotic/ vascular disorders ) if your levels of the red blood pigment are too high .
If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor or pharmacist .

Solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe ( injection )
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
4 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
5 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
6 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
8 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
9 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
11 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
18 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
19 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
20 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
22 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
23 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
25 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
26 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
32 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
33 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
34 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
36 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
37 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
39 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
40 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
46 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
47 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
48 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
50 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
51 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
53 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
54 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
60 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
61 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
62 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
64 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
65 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
67 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
68 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
74 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
75 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
76 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
78 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
79 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
81 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
82 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
88 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
89 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
90 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
92 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
93 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
95 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
96 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
102 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
103 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
104 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
106 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
107 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
109 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
110 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
116 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
117 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
118 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
120 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
121 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
123 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
124 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in adult and paediatric patients :
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal origin accompanied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis ( See section 4.4 ) .
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient 's general status ( e. g. cardiovascular status , pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme .
Its use in this indication must be balanced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events .
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia ( haemoglobin ( Hb ) 10 13 g/ dl [ 6.2 8.1 mmol/ l ] , no iron deficiency ) , if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males ) .
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery , having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications .
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia ( e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl ) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml .
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of physicians experienced in the management of patients with the above indications .
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients :
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously ( see section 4.4 ) .
The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) , except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) over a four week period should be avoided .
If it occurs , appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provided .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management , with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be avoided .
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous level .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia .
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary .
In addition , other causes of anaemia , such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be excluded before instituting therapy with epoetin alfa .
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following causes : iron , folate , or vitamin B12 deficiency ; aluminium intoxication ; intercurrent infections ; inflammatory or traumatic episodes ; occult blood loss ; haemolysis , and bone marrow fibrosis of any origin .
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of at least four weeks .
At each step , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 10 und 12 g/dl ( 6,2 - 7,5 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route .
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
When a dose adjustment is necessary , this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achieved .
Die Dosisanpassung sollte so gewählt werden , dass die Hämoglobin-Zielkonzentration zwischen 9,5 und 11 g/dl ( 5,9 - 6,8 mmol/l ) liegt . Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl ( 5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l ) .
Generally , children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adults .
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment :
Usual maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low ( < 6.8 g/ dl or or
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equal injections .
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis :
The treatment is divided into two stages :
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route , followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments ( 3 times per week ) until the desired goal is achieved ( this should be done in steps of at least four weeks ) .
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level :
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route .
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia :
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia ( e. g. haemoglobin concentration 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) .
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age , gender , and overall burden of disease ; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary .
Due to intra-patient variability , occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed .
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl ( 6.2 mmol/ l ) to 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) should be
130 avoided ; guidance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values exceeding 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) are observed are described below .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia .
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy .
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week .
Alternatively , epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly .
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment , the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly .
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week , the haemoglobin has increased 1 g/ dl ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) or the reticulocyte count has increased 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week .
However , if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl ( < 0.62 mmol/ l ) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline , response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued .
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following diagram :
131 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month , or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) , the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50 % .
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l ) , discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25 % below the previous dose .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme :
At the time of donating blood , Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedure .
Mildly anaemic patients ( haematocrit of 33 - 39 % ) requiring predeposit of 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
Alle Patienten unter Abseamed sollen während der Behandlung eine adäquate Eisensubstitution erhalten ( z.B. orale Eisensubstitution mit 200 mg Fe2+ pro Tag ) . 200 mg oral elemental iron daily ) throughout the course of treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible , even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy .
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery :
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used .
132 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa , given weekly for three weeks ( days 21 , 14 and 7 ) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks , 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery , on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter .
When performing haematologic assessments during the preoperative period , if the haemoglobin level reaches 15 g/ dl , or higher , administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given .
Care should be taken to ensure that at the outset of the treatment patients are not iron deficient .
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation ( e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily ) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment .
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy , to achieve adequate iron stores .
Abseamed ist ein steriles , jedoch nicht konserviertes Produkt und nur zur einmaligen Anwendung bestimmt . Administer the amount required .
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion , or mixed with other medicinal products .
Intravenous injection : over at least one to five minutes , depending on the total dose .
In haemodialysed patients , a bolus injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous port in the dialysis line .
Alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing , followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation .
A slower injection is preferable in patients who react to the treatment with flu-like symptoms .
Subcutaneous injection : a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be exceeded .
In case of larger volumes , more than one site should be chosen for the injection .
The injections are given in the thighs or the anterior abdominal wall .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutaneously !
The intravenous route has to be used ( please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin ( see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia ) .
In the indication increasing the yield of autologous blood : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment , unstable angina pectoris , increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease .
Patients who for any reason cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis .
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary , peripheral arterial , carotid or cerebral vascular disease , including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa , blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated
Eine zusätzliche oder verstärkte antihypertensive Therapie kann notwendig sein . It may be necessary to add or increase antihypertensive treatment .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued .
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa .
This regresses during the course of continued therapy .
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia ( iron deficiency , haemolysis , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies ) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa .
In most cases , the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume .
In order to ensure optimum response to epoetin alfa , adequate iron stores should be assured :
- Orale Eisensubstitution , beispielsweise 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/Tag ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/Tag für 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally ( 100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients ) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transferrin saturation is below 20 % .
All of these additive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when deciding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients .
Good blood management practices should always be used in the perisurgical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( PRCA ) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment .
In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin ( 1 to 2 g/ dl per month ) with increased need for transfusions , a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response ( e. g. iron , folate or , vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium intoxication , infection or inflammation , blood loss and haemolysis ) should be investigated .
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia ( i. e. , the reticulocyte index ) is low ( < 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5 % ) , platelet and white blood cell counts are normal , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found , anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA .
If anti-erythropoietin , antibody-mediated PRCA is suspected , therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately .
No other erythropoietic therapy should be commenced because of the risk of cross-reaction .
Appropriate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated .
Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA , i. e. patients with renal anaemia , are not sufficient .
Therefore , in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously .
In patients with chronic renal failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2 .
In clinical trials , an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) .
Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
134 ( 0.62 mmol/ l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension .
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in isolated cases .
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and potassium and protein intake .
Dialysis prescriptions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
Serum electrolytes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients .
If an elevated ( or rising ) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ceasing epoetin alfa administration until hyperkalaemia has been corrected .
An increase in heparin dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume .
Occlusion of the dialysis system is possible if heparinisation is not optimum .
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure , maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2 .
Based on information available to date , correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy , the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate ( patient at risk of being transfused ) .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter .
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl ( 1.25 mmol/ l ) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl ( 8.1 mmol/ l)m , the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl ) .
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( TVEs ) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( see section 4.8 ) , this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment ( with epoetin alfa ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
An investigational study ( BEST study ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was designed to determine whether epoetin alfa treatment that extended beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcomes .
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo ( see section 5.1 ) .
In view of the above , in some clinical situations blood transfusions should be the preferred treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer .
The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
Factors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage ; the degree of anaemia ; life-expectancy ; the environment in which the patient is being treated ; and patient preference ( see section 5.1 ) .
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programmes , especially routine volume replacement , should be respected .
135 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of epoetin alfa treatment .
Thrombotic events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis , as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients , especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease .
In addition , special precaution should be taken in patients with predisposition for development of deep vein thrombosis ( DVTs ) .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
Therefore , it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl .
Erythropoietins are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
As with all growth factors , there is a concern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tumours .
In several controlled studies , epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer .
In controlled clinical studies , use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESAs ) have shown :
- decreased locoregional control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl ( 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- shortened overall survival and increased deaths attributed to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl ( 7.5 8.7 mmol/ l ) ,
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl ( 7.5 mmol/ l ) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving neither chemotherapy nor radiation therapy .
ESAs are not indicated for use in this patient population .
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium ( 23 mg ) per dose , i. e. essentially sodium- free .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alters the metabolism of other medicinal products .
However , since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an interaction .
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin , blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises .
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro .
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women .
Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
- In chronic renal failure patients , epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus .
- In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
programme , the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines .
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
Hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur .
Attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Non-specific skin rashes have been described in association with epoetin alfa .
" Flu-like " symptoms such as headaches , joint pains , feelings of weakness , dizziness , and tiredness may occur , especially at the start of treatment .
Thrombocytosis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare ( see section 4.4 ) .
Thrombotic/ vascular events , such as myocardial ischaemia , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accidents ( cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction ) , transient ischaemic attacks , deep vein thrombosis , arterial thrombosis , pulmonary emboli , aneurysms , retinal thrombosis , and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents , including patients receiving epoetin alfa .
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction .
Antibody-mediated erythroblastopenia ( PRCA ) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa .
In most of these patients , antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed ( see sections 4.3 and 4.4 Pure Red Cell Aplasia )
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients , adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension .
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products .
Moreover , monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy .
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressure : hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms ( e. g. headaches and confused state ) and generalised tonoclonal seizures , requiring the immediate attention of a physician and intensive medical care .
Particular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine- like headaches as a possible warning signal .
Shunt thromboses may occur , especially in patients who have a tendency to hypotension or whose arteriovenous fistulae exhibit complications ( e. g. stenoses , aneurysms , etc. ) .
Early shunt revision and thrombosis prophylaxis by administration of acetylsalicylic acid , for example , is recommended in these patients .
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hypertension may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients .
Consequently , haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored .
137 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents .
Independent of erythropoietin treatment , thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy .
Therefore , routine volume replacement should be performed in such patients .
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery , with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl , the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events ( most of which were DVTs ) , in the overall patient population of the clinical trials , appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group , although the clinical experience is limited .
Moreover , in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl , the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded .
The therapeutic margin of epoetin alfa is very wide .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are extensions of the pharmacological effects of the hormone .
Phlebotomy may be performed if excessively high haemoglobin levels occur .
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antianaemic , ATC code :
Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein that stimulates , as a mitosis-stimulating factor and differentiating hormone , the formation of erythrocytes from precursors of the stem cell compartment .
The apparent molecular weight of erythropoietin is 32,000 to 40,000 dalton .
The protein fraction of the molecule contributes about 58 % and consists of 165 amino acids .
The four carbohydrate chains are attached via three N-glycosidic bonds and one O-glycosidic bond to the protein .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients .
Abseamed has the highest possible purity according to the present state of the art .
In particular , no residues of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans .
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo ( normal and anaemic rats , polycythaemic mice ) .
After administration of epoetin alfa , the number of erythrocytes , the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59Fe-incorporation rate .
An increased 3H-thymidine incorporation in the erythroid nucleated spleen cells has been found in vitro ( mouse spleen cell culture ) after incubation with epoetin alfa .
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis .
Cytotoxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detected .
138 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies , 389 patients with haematological malignancies ( 221 multiple myeloma , 144 non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , and 24 other haematological malignancies ) and 332 with solid tumours ( 172 breast , 64 gynaecological , 23 lung , 22 prostate , 21 gastro-intestinal , and 30 other tumour types ) .
In two large , open-label studies , 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included , 1895 with solid tumours ( 683 breast , 260 lung , 174 gynaecological , 300 gastro-intestinal , and 478 other tumour types ) and 802 with haematological malignancies .
In a prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-myeloid malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy , there was a significant reduction of anaemia-related sequelae ( e. g. fatigue , decreased energy , and activity reduction ) , as measured by the following instruments and scales :
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Anaemia ( FACT-An ) general scale , FACT-An fatigue scale , and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale ( CLAS ) .
Two other smaller , randomised , placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in quality of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLAS , respectively .
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production .
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells .
Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients , of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study .
The studies either recruited patients who were being treated with chemotherapy ( two studies ) or used patient populations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indicated : anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy , and head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy .
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl .
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls .
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratios for overall survival ranged between 1.25 and 2.47 in favour of controls .
These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls .
Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group .
A systematic review has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials .
Meta-analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate of 1.08 in favour of controls ( 95 % CI :
0.99 , 1,18 ; 42 trials and 8167 patients ) .
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events ( RR 1.67 , 95 % CI :
1.35 , 2.06 , 35 trials and 6769 patients ) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer , treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl , is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed .
Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients , approximately 5 hours .
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children .
Following subcutaneous injection , serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection , the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route ( approximately 1/ 20th of the value ) .
There is no accumulation : the levels remain the same , whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection .
The half-life is difficult to evaluate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours .
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product : approximately 20 % .
In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats , but not in monkeys , epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis ( bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors .
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa . ) .
In animal studies , epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight , delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose .
These changes are interpreted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain .
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacterial and mammalian cell culture mutagenicity tests and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out .
There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding whether erythropoietins may play a major role as tumour proliferators .
These reports are based on in vitro findings from human tumour samples , but are of uncertain significance in the clinical situation .

What Abseamed is and what it is used for 2.
WHAT ABSEAMED IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Abseamed contains a hormone called epoetin alfa , which stimulates the production of red blood cells .
Epoetin alfa is produced by a specialised genetic technology and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin .
Abseamed is used : for treating symptomatic anaemia associated with kidney disease ( given by injection into a vein ) in children and adults on dialysis in adults on peritoneal dialysis for treating severe symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease in adults not yet undergoing dialysis ( given by injection into a vein ) for treating anaemia and reducing the need for a blood transfusion in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours , malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the doctor in moderately anaemic patients who are going to have surgery and prior to it , donate blood so that their own blood can be given to them during or after surgery ( autologous predonation ) as an alternative to a blood transfusion in adult patients about to undergo major orthopaedic ( bone ) surgery where there is a potentially high risk from blood transfusion complications
- if you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of Abseamed
- if you have developed Pure Red Cell Aplasia ( reduced or stopped production of red blood cells )
- if you have high blood pressure which is not properly controlled
- if you are donating your own blood before surgery , and :
you had a heart attack or stroke in the month before your treatment you have unstable angina pectoris ( new or increasing chest pain ) you are at risk of blood clots in the veins ( deep venous thrombosis ) for example , if you have had clots before
- if you cannot receive adequate treatment for the prevention of blood clots ( antithrombotic
- if you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery and :
you have severe disorders of blood circulation of the heart ( coronary heart disease ) , arteries of the legs or arms ( peripheral arterial occlusive disease ) , neck vessels ( vascular disease of the carotids ) or the brain ( cerebrovascular disease ) you had a recent heart attack or stroke
If any of these applies to you , or might apply , tell your doctor at once .
In all patients treated with Abseamed blood pressure should be closely monitored and treated , if necessary .
Abseamed should be used with caution in the presence of untreated , inadequately treated or poorly controllable hypertension .
It may be necessary to initiate or increase treatment against high blood pressure .
If blood pressure cannot be controlled , Abseamed treatment should be discontinued .
Take special care with Abseamed if you have epilepsy or chronic liver disease .
There may be a moderate dose-dependent increase in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with Abseamed , which gradually regresses during the course of continued therapy .
Your doctor may do regular blood tests to check your blood platelet count during the first 8 weeks of therapy .
All other causes of anaemia , e. g. iron deficiency , damage of red blood cells ( haemolysis ) , blood loss , vitamin B12 or folate deficiency , should be taken into account and treated prior to initiating therapy with Abseamed .
In order to ensure optimum response to Abseamed adequate iron stores should be ensured .
Your doctor may do blood tests to decide , if you need iron supplements .
Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of subcutaneous ( injection under the skin ) erythropoietin treatment .
PRCA means the inability to produce enough red blood cells in the bone marrow .
PRCA can result in sudden and severe anaemia , the symptoms of which are unusual tiredness , feeling dizzy or breathlessness .
If you experience these symptoms you should talk to your doctor at once .
Your doctor can decide whether Abseamed is not working properly for you .
If you develop PRCA your Abseamed therapy will be discontinued and your doctor will decide how best to treat your anaemia .
There is not much experience with subcutaneous use ( injection into the skin ) of Abseamed in kidney patients .
Therefore , if you are being treated for anaemia associated with kidney disease , Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein ( intravenously ) .
Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) regularly
- to ensure that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level as high haemoglobin could put
you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of death
- to minimise the risk of an increase in blood pressure .
Increased levels of potassium ( hyperkalaemia ) have been observed in isolated cases .
The correction of your anaemia may lead to increased appetite , and thus increased potassium and protein intake .
Therefore dialysis procedures may have to be adjusted to maintain urea , creatinine and potassium in the desired range .
If an elevated or increasing serum potassium level is detected , your doctor may consider to discontinue the treatment with Abseamed until the potassium level has returned to the normal range .
An increase in dose of a particular blood-thinning medicine ( heparin ) during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with Abseamed .
Inadequate thinning of the blood by heparin ( heparinisation ) may lead to occlusion of the dialysis system .
If you have chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or signs of congestion due to inadequate heart output , your doctor will make sure that your haemoglobin levels do not exceed a certain level .
Based on information available to date , treatment of anaemia with Abseamed in adult patients with chronic kidney failure ( renal insufficiency ) who do not yet require dialysis , does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency .
The 2-3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of desired effects should be taken into account when assessing the efficacy of Abseamed .
Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) regularly and adjust your dose of Abseamed accordingly to minimise the risk of blood clotting ( thrombotic events ) .
Cancer patients receiving treatment with erythropoietin have an increased risk of blood clots/ blood clotting disorders ( thrombotic vascular events ) .
This risk should be carefully weighted against the benefit to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa , particularly if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events , e. g. if you are obese or have a history of thrombotic vascular events ( e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) .
If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Abseamed may act as a blood cell growth factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer .
Depending on your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable .
Please discuss this with your doctor .
Patients donating their own blood before surgery
Your doctor will consider warnings and precautions associated with autologous blood predonation , especially volume replacement .
If you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery , the cause of anaemia should be established and treated , if possible , before the start of Abseamed treatment .
Blood clots ( thrombotic events ) can be a
Ihr Arzt wird dieses Risiko sorgfältig gegenüber den aus der Behandlung mit Epoetin alfa abgeleiteten Vorteilen abwägen . Your doctor will weight this risk carefully against the benefits to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa .
You should receive adequate measures in order to prevent blood clots ( thrombotic prophylaxis ) , particularly if you have cardiovascular disorders .
If your levels of the red blood pigment ( haemoglobin ) are too high you should not receive Abseamed , since you have an increased risk of blood clotting after the surgery .
If you are a cancer patient be aware that erythropoietins may act as growth factor .
Please discuss this with your doctor .
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines , including medicines obtained without a prescription .
If you are taking cyclosporin ( medicine to suppress your immune system ) during therapy with Abseamed , your doctor may order special blood tests to measure cyclosporin levels .
Laboratory tests did not show an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF ( G-CSF and GM-CSF are medicines to stimulate the immune-system e. g. when receiving a chemotherapy for cancer or in case of HIV ) .
There is not much experience with Abseamed in pregnant women or women who are breast-feeding .
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine .
No effects on ability to drive or use machines have been observed .

Instructions for injecting Abseamed under the skin
If you are a kidney patient Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein .
Do not give by injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
The amount injected in any one place should not normally exceed one mililitre ( 1 ml ) .
The injections are given preferably in the thigh or the front part of the abdominal wall .
At the start of your therapy , Abseamed may be injected by medical staff .
However , your doctor may decide that it is right for you to learn how to inject Abseamed under the skin yourself .
You will receive appropriate training for you to do this .
Under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself unless you have been trained to do so .
Remove one syringe from the pack and remove the protective cap from the injection needle .
Clean the skin at the injection site using an alcohol wipe .
Form a skin fold by pinching the skin between thumb and forefinger .
Insert the needle into the skin fold with a quick , firm action .
Ensure that you only inject the amount as instructed by your doctor or nurse .
Withdraw the needle quickly and apply pressure over the injection site with a dry , sterile pad .
Only use each syringe for one injection .
