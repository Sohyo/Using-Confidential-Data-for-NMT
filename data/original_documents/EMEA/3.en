Each tablet contains 5 mg of aripiprazole .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Rectangular and blue , engraved with " A-007 " and " 5 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 3 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
5 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
8 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
9 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .

Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .

During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 14 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
15 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
16 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
19 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
20 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each tablet contains 15 mg of aripiprazole .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Round and yellow , engraved with " A-009 " and " 15 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 25 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
26 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
27 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
30 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
31 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each tablet contains 30 mg of aripiprazole .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Round and pink , engraved with " A-011 " and " 30 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 36 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
37 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
38 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
41 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
42 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each orodispersible tablet contains 10 mg of aripiprazole .
2 mg aspartame ( E951 ) per orodispersible tablet
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Orodispersible tablet Round and pink , marked with " A " over " 640 " on one side and " 10 " on the other .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
46 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
47 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
48 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
49 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
50 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
52 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each orodispersible tablet contains 15 mg of aripiprazole .
3 mg aspartame ( E951 ) per orodispersible tablet
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Orodispersible tablet Round and yellow , marked with " A " over " 641 " on one side and " 15 " on the other .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
58 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
59 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
60 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
61 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
62 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
64 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each orodispersible tablet contains 30 mg of aripiprazole .
6 mg aspartame ( E951 ) per orodispersible tablet
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Orodispersible tablet Round and pink , marked with " A " over " 643 " on one side and " 30 " on the other .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
70 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
71 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
72 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
73 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :

Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
76 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Oral solution Clear , colourless to light yellow liquid .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
ABILIFY oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day ( i. e.
10 or 15 ml solution/ day ) with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
A calibrated measuring cup and a 2 ml calibrated dropper are included in the carton .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day ( i. e.
10 to 30 ml solution/ day ) .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Die empfohlene Anfangsdosis für ABILIFY beträgt 15 mg einmal täglich , unabhängig von den Mahlzeiten als Monotherapie oder Kombinationstherapie ( siehe Abschnitt 5.1 ) . 15 ml solution/ day ) administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
Die maximale Tagesdosis sollte 30 mg nicht überschreiten . 30 ml solution/ day ) .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
82 For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see sections 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
83 Tardive dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
84 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product .
The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reactions ( possibly delayed ) .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance , glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the oral solution .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
85 When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
86 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
88 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N = 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N = 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
At equivalent doses , the peak plasma concentrations of aripiprazole ( Cmax ) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic
90 exposure ( AUC ) was equivalent to tablets .
In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects , the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax values was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
The single- dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were
91 observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each ml contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole .
A vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Solution for injection Clear , colourless , aqueous solution .
ABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
Treatment with aripiprazole solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically appropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated .
To enhance absorption and minimise variability , injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus maximus muscle , avoiding adipose regions , is recommended .
ABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously .
ABILIFY solution for injection is ready to use and intended for short-term use only ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended initial dose for aripiprazole solution for injection is 9.75 mg ( 1.3 ml ) , administered as a single intramuscular injection .
The effective dose range of aripiprazole solution for injection is 5.25-15 mg as a single injection .
A lower dose of 5.25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given , on the basis of individual clinical status , which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
A second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection , on the basis of individual clinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period .
The maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg ( including all formulations of aripiprazole ) .
If continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole , see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ABILIFY tablets , ABILIFY orodispersible tablets , or ABILIFY oral solution .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients who are 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has not been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder .
Simultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be associated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression .
If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection , patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension ( see section 4.5 ) .
Patients receiving aripiprazole solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension .
Blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly .
The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication ( either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products ) .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazol sollte mit Vorsicht bei Patienten mit bekannten kardiovaskulären Erkrankungen ( Myokardinfarkt oder ischämische Herzerkrankung , Herzinsuffizienz , Überleitungsstörungen ) , zerebrovaskulären Erkrankungen , Bedingungen , die für Hypotonie prädisponieren ( Dehydratation , Hypovolämie , Behandlung mit blutdrucksenkenden Arzneimitteln ) oder Hypertonie ( einschließlich akzelerierte und maligne Form ) angewendet werden . 95 conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
96 Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
The administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administered concomitantly .
However , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subjects , administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone .
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
97 Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
The administration of aripiprazole solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly .
However , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subjects , administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone .
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Muttermilch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .

Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
99 Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
Agitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with aripiprazole solution for injection :
In two short- term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic patients presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours , aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol .
In one short-term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours , aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam .
The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for lorazepam , and 8.7 for aripiprazole .
In subpopulation analyses on patients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation , a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , oral aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on oral aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for oral haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on oral aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to oral olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole :
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
102 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole solution for injection administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and has an absolute bioavailability of 100 % .
The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations .
In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Administration of aripiprazole solution for injection was well tolerated and produced no direct target organ toxicity in rats or monkeys after repeated dosing at systemic exposures ( AUC ) that were 15 and 5 times , respectively , human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramuscular .
In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies , no new safety concerns were observed at maternal exposures up to 15 ( rat ) and 29 ( rabbit ) times human exposure at 30 mg .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional oral aripiprazole studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose 2 or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 3 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
5 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
8 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
9 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each tablet contains 10 mg of aripiprazole .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Rectangular and pink , engraved with " A-008 " and " 10 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 14 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
15 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
16 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
19 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
20 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each tablet contains 15 mg of aripiprazole .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Round and yellow , engraved with " A-009 " and " 15 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 25 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
26 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
27 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
30 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
31 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each tablet contains 30 mg of aripiprazole .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Tablet Round and pink , engraved with " A-011 " and " 30 " on one side .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
Bei diesen Patienten sollte die Dosierung vorsichtig eingestellt werden . However , the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Klinische Manifestationen eines MNS sind hohes Fieber , Muskelrigidität , wechselnde Bewusstseinslagen und Anzeichen autonomer Instabilität ( unregelmäßiger Puls oder Blutdruck , Tachykardie , Schwitzen und Herzrhythmusstörungen ) . 36 mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Lactose : patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance , the lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
37 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
38 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
41 It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
42 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each orodispersible tablet contains 10 mg of aripiprazole .
2 mg aspartame ( E951 ) per orodispersible tablet
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Orodispersible tablet Round and pink , marked with " A " over " 640 " on one side and " 10 " on the other .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
46 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
47 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
48 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
49 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/

Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
52 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each orodispersible tablet contains 15 mg of aripiprazole .
3 mg aspartame ( E951 ) per orodispersible tablet
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Orodispersible tablet Round and yellow , marked with " A " over " 641 " on one side and " 15 " on the other .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
58 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
59 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
60 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
61 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
62 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
64 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Each orodispersible tablet contains 30 mg of aripiprazole .
6 mg aspartame ( E951 ) per orodispersible tablet
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Orodispersible tablet Round and pink , marked with " A " over " 643 " on one side and " 30 " on the other .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
The orodispersible tablet should be placed in the mouth on the tongue , where it will rapidly disperse in saliva .
It can be taken with or without liquid .
Removal of the intact orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficult .
Since the orodispersible tablet is fragile , it should be taken immediately on opening the blister .
Alternatively , disperse the tablet in water and drink the resulting suspension .
70 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swallow ABILIFY tablets ( see also section 5.2 ) .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
71 Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
72 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain aspartame , a source of phenylalanine which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
73 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/
74 Cardiac disorders Uncommon : tachycardia* Nervous System disorders Common : extrapyramidal disorder , akathisia , tremor , dizziness , somnolence , sedation , headache Eye disorders Common : blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common : dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea , constipation , salivary hypersecretion Vascular disorders Uncommon : orthostatic hypotension* General disorders and administration site conditions Common : fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common : restlessness , insomnia , anxiety Uncommon : depression*
Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
76 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bioequivalent to aripiprazole tablets , with a similar rate and extent of absorption .
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an alternative to aripiprazole tablets .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Oral solution Clear , colourless to light yellow liquid .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia .
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
ABILIFY oral solution may be used as an alternative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day ( i. e.
10 or 15 ml solution/ day ) with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals .
A calibrated measuring cup and a 2 ml calibrated dropper are included in the carton .
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day ( i. e.
10 to 30 ml solution/ day ) .
Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg .
Die empfohlene Anfangsdosis für ABILIFY beträgt 15 mg einmal täglich , unabhängig von den Mahlzeiten als Monotherapie oder Kombinationstherapie ( siehe Abschnitt 5.1 ) . 15 ml solution/ day ) administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose .
Die maximale Tagesdosis sollte 30 mg nicht überschreiten . 30 ml solution/ day ) .
Recurrence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder :
82 For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole , continue therapy at the same dose .
Adjustments of daily dosage , including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical status .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Patients with hepatic impairment : no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to establish recommendations .
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see sections 4.4 and 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease , heart failure , or conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
83 Tardive dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
This difference was not statistically significant .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
84 Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product .
The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate and propyl parahydroxybenzoate which may cause allergic reactions ( possibly delayed ) .
Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance , glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take the oral solution .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
85 When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Milch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention : common ( > 1/ 100 , , 1/

Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .

jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
88 Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on aripiprazole ( N = 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to olanzapine ( N = 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
Diese Studien beinhalteten Patienten mit oder ohne psychotischen Merkmalen und mit oder ohne Rapid-Cycling Verlauf . These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole is well absorbed , with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 3-5 hours after dosing .
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet formulation is 87 % .
There is no effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
At equivalent doses , the peak plasma concentrations of aripiprazole ( Cmax ) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic
90 exposure ( AUC ) was equivalent to tablets .
In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects , the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax values was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
The single- dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were linear and dose-proportional .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2 ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Aripiprazole did not impair fertility in reproductive toxicity studies .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were
91 observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .

Detailed information on this product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) http : / /www . emea . europa . eu/
Each ml contains 7.5 mg of aripiprazole .
A vial contains 9.75 mg aripiprazole .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Solution for injection Clear , colourless , aqueous solution .
ABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder , when oral therapy is not appropriate .
Treatment with aripiprazole solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically appropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated .
To enhance absorption and minimise variability , injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus maximus muscle , avoiding adipose regions , is recommended .
ABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously .
ABILIFY solution for injection is ready to use and intended for short-term use only ( see section 5.1 ) .
The recommended initial dose for aripiprazole solution for injection is 9.75 mg ( 1.3 ml ) , administered as a single intramuscular injection .
The effective dose range of aripiprazole solution for injection is 5.25-15 mg as a single injection .
A lower dose of 5.25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given , on the basis of individual clinical status , which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
A second injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection , on the basis of individual clinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 24-hour period .
The maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg ( including all formulations of aripiprazole ) .
If continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole , see the Summary of Product Characteristics for ABILIFY tablets , ABILIFY orodispersible tablets , or ABILIFY oral solution .
Children and adolescents : there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , the data available are insufficient to
In these patients dosing should be managed cautiously .
However , the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see section 5.2 ) .
Patients with renal impairment : no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment .
Elderly : the effectiveness of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients who are 65 years of age or older has not been established .
Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population , a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant ( see section 4.4 ) .
Gender : no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients ( see section 5.2 ) .
Smoking status : according to the metabolic pathway of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smokers ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be reduced .
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy , aripiprazole dose should then be increased ( see section 4.5 ) .
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with aripiprazole occurs , the aripiprazole dose should be increased .
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy , the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has not been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder .
Simultaneous administration of injectable antipsychotics and parenteral benzodiazepine may be associated with excessive sedation and cardiorespiratory depression .
If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection , patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension ( see section 4.5 ) .
Patients receiving aripiprazole solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypotension .
Blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regularly .
The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with alcohol or medicinal product intoxication ( either with prescribed or illicit medicinal products ) .
During antipsychotic treatment , improvement in the patient 's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks .
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period .
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy , including treatment with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
Close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany antipsychotic therapy .
Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder .
Aripiprazol sollte mit Vorsicht bei Patienten mit bekannten kardiovaskulären Erkrankungen ( Myokardinfarkt oder ischämische Herzerkrankung , Herzinsuffizienz , Überleitungsstörungen ) , zerebrovaskulären Erkrankungen , Bedingungen , die für Hypotonie prädisponieren ( Dehydratation , Hypovolämie , Behandlung mit blutdrucksenkenden Arzneimitteln ) oder Hypertonie ( einschließlich akzelerierte und maligne Form ) angewendet werden . 95 conduction abnormalities ) , cerebrovascular disease , conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension ( dehydration , hypovolemia , and treatment with antihypertensive medications ) or hypertension , including accelerated or malignant .
In clinical trials of aripiprazole , the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo .
As with other antipsychotics , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolongation .
Tardive Dyskinesia : in clinical trials of one year or less duration , there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole .
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY , dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered .
These symptoms can temporally deteriorate or can even arise after discontinuation of treatment .
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) :
NMS is a potentially fatal symptom complex associated with antipsychotic medicinal products .
In clinical trials , rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia , muscle rigidity , altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , tachycardia , diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia ) .
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase , myoglobinuria ( rhabdomyolysis ) , and acute renal failure .
However , elevated creatine phosphokinase and rhabdomyolysis , not necessarily in association with NMS , have also been reported .
If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS , or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS , all antipsychotic medicinal products , including ABILIFY , must be discontinued .
Seizure : in clinical trials , uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole .
Therefore , aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures .
Increased mortality : in three placebo-controlled trials ( n= 938 ; mean age :
56-99 years ) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer 's disease , patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo .
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5 % compared to 1.7 % in the placebo group .
Although the causes of deaths were varied , most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular ( e. g. heart failure , sudden death ) or infectious ( e. g. pneumonia ) in nature .
Cerebrovascular adverse events : in the same trials , cerebrovascular adverse events ( e. g. stroke , transient ischaemic attack ) , including fatalities , were reported in patients ( mean age :
Overall , 1.3 % of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.6 % of placebo-treated patients in these trials .
However , in one of these trials , a fixed-dose trial , there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole .
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis .
Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus : hyperglycaemia , in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death , has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY .
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabetes .
In clinical trials with aripiprazole , there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events ( including diabetes ) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo .
Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to allow direct comparisons .
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents , including ABILIFY , should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia ( such as polydipsia , polyuria , polyphagia and weakness ) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control .
96 Weight gain : weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities , use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain , poorly managed life-style , and might lead to severe complications .
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY .
When seen , it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes , thyroid disorder or pituitary adenoma .
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain ( see section 5.1 ) .
Dysphagia : oesophageal dysmotility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic drug use , including ABILIFY .
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic drugs should be used cautiously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia .
Hypersensitivity : as with other medications hypersensitivity reactions , characterised by allergic symptoms , may occur with aripiprazole ( see section 4.8 ) .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its 1-adrenergic receptor antagonism , aripiprazole has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents .
Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole , caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation ( see section 4.8 ) .
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electrolyte imbalance , caution should be used .
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY :
The administration of lorazepam solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administered concomitantly .
However , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subjects , administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone .
A gastric acid blocker , the H2 antagonist famotidine , reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant .
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple pathways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1A enzymes .
Thus , no dosage adjustment is required for smokers .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( quinidine ) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107 % , while Cmax was unchanged .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , decreased by 32 % and 47 % .
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinidine occurs .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine and paroxetine , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( ketoconazole ) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 63 % and 37 % , respectively .
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77 % and 43 % , respectively .
In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers , concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY , potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient .
When concomitant administration of ketoconozole with ABILIFY occurs , ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose .
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors , may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied .
97 Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy .
When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e. g. , diltiazem or escitalopram ) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY , modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected .
Following concomitant administration of carbamazepine , a potent inducer of CYP3A4 , the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68 % and 73 % lower , respectively , compared to when aripiprazole ( 30 mg ) was administered alone .
Similarly , for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazepine co-administration were 69 % and 71 % lower , respectively , than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone .
ABILIFY dose should be doubled when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazepine .
Es ist zu erwarten , dass andere hochwirksame Induktoren von CYP3A4 ( wie Rifampicin , Rifabutin , Phenytoin , Phenobarbital , Primidon , Efavirenz , Nevirapin und Johanniskraut ) ähnliche Wirkungen haben und deshalb sollten ähnliche Dosiserhöhungen vorgenommen werden . John 's Wort ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied .
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 inducers , the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose .
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole , there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations .
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal products :
The administration of aripiprazole solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam solution for injection when administered concomitantly .
However , in a single-dose , intramuscular study of aripiprazole ( dose 15 mg ) in healthy subjects , administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam ( dose 2 mg ) , the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone .
In clinical studies , 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 ( dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio ) , 2C9 ( warfarin ) , 2C19 ( omeprazole ) , and 3A4 ( dextromethorphan ) .
Additionally , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for altering CYP1A2-mediated metabolism in vitro .
Thus , aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product interactions mediated by these enzymes .
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations .
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women .
Animal studies could not exclude potential developmental toxicity ( see section 5.3 ) .
Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole .
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies , this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus .
Aripiprazole was excreted in the milk of treated rats during lactation .
Da nicht bekannt ist , ob Aripiprazol beim Menschen in die Muttermilch ausgeschieden wird , sollte den Patientinnen geraten werden , während der Einnahme von Aripiprazol nicht zu stillen . Patients should be advised not to breast feed if they are taking aripiprazole .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed .
However , as with other antipsychotics , patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely .
The following undesirable effects occurred more often ( 1/ 100 ) than placebo , or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions ( * ) in clinical trials with aripiprazole solution for injection ( see section 5.1 ) :

Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial , aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence ( 25.8 % ) of EPS including parkinsonism , akathisia , dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol ( 57.3 % ) .
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 19 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1 % for placebo-treated patients .
In another long-term 26-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 14.8 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1 % for olanzapine-treated patients .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 23.5 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3 % for haloperidol-treated patients .
In another 12-week trial , the incidence of EPS was 26.6 % for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6 % for those treated with lithium .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.2 % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7 % for placebo-treated patients .
In placebo-controlled trials , the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12.1 % with aripiprazole and 3.2 % with placebo .
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.2 % with aripiprazole and 3.0 % with placebo .
99 Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences .
Elevations of CPK ( Creatine Phosphokinase ) , generally transient and asymptomatic , were observed in 3.5 % of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0 % of patients who received placebo .
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome , tardive dyskinesia , seizure , cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients , hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus ( see section 4.4 ) .
The following adverse events have been reported during post-marketing surveillance .
The frequency of these events is considered not known ( cannot be estimated from the available data ) .
increased Creatine Phosphokinase , blood glucose increased , blood glucose fluctuation , glycosylated haemoglobin increased
QT prolongation , ventricular arrhythmias , sudden unexplained death , cardiac arrest , torsades de pointes , bradycardia
speech disorder , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome ( NMS ) , grand mal convulsion
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders :
pancreatitis , dysphagia , abdominal discomfort , stomach discomfort , diarrhoea
rash , photosensitivity reaction , alopecia , hyperhidrosis
hyperglycaemia , diabetes mellitus , diabetic ketoacidosis , diabetic hyperosmolar coma
weight gain , weight decreased , anorexia , hyponatremia
General disorders and administration site conditions :
temperature regulation disorder ( e. g. hypothermia , pyrexia ) , chest pain , peripheral oedema
allergic reaction ( e. g. anaphylactic reaction , angioedema including swollen tongue , tongue oedema , face oedema , pruritus , or urticaria )
jaundice , hepatitis , increased Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) , increased Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) , increased Gamma Glutamyl Transferase ( GGT ) , increased alkaline phosphatase
agitation , nervousness ; suicide attempt , suicidal ideation , and completed suicide ( see section 4.4 )
In clinical trials and post-marketing experience , accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities .
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included lethargy , increased blood pressure , somnolence , tachycardia , nausea , vomiting and diarrhoea .
In addition , reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone ( up to 195 mg ) in children have been received with no fatalities .
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence , transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms .
Management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy , maintaining an adequate airway , oxygenation and ventilation , and management of symptoms .
The possibility of multiple medicinal product involvement should be considered .
Therefore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias .
Following any confirmed or suspected overdose with aripiprazole , close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers .
Activated charcoal ( 50 g ) , administered one hour after aripiprazole , decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 41 % and AUC by about 51 % , suggesting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of overdose .
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole , haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins .
Pharmacotherapeutic group : antipsychotics , ATC code :
It has been proposed that aripiprazole s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors .
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyperactivity and agonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypoactivity .
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3 , serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4 , serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7 , alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors .
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin reuptake site and no appreciable affinity for muscarinic receptors .
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin subtypes may explain some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole .
Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride , a D2/ D3 receptor ligand , to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography .
Agitation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with aripiprazole solution for injection :
In two short- term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic patients presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours , aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol .
In one short-term ( 24-hour ) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours , aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam .
The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo , 9.6 for lorazepam , and 8.7 for aripiprazole .
In subpopulation analyses on patients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation , a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size .
In three short-term ( 4 to 6 weeks ) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients , presenting with positive or negative symptoms , oral aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo .
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continuation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment response .
In a haloperidol-controlled trial , the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups ( oral aripiprazole 77 % and haloperidol 73 % ) .
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on oral aripiprazole ( 43 % ) than for oral haloperidol ( 30 % ) .
Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints , including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol .
In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia , oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate , 34 % in oral aripiprazole group and 57 % in placebo .
Weight gain : in clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain .
In a 26-week , olanzapine-controlled , double-blind , multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain , significantly less patients had at least 7 % weight gain over baseline ( i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg ) on oral aripiprazole ( N= 18 , or 13 % of evaluable patients ) , compared to oral olanzapine ( N= 45 , or 33 % of evaluable patients ) .
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazole :
In two 3-week , flexible-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks .
These trials included patients with or without psychotic features and with or without a rapid-cycling course .
In one 3-week , fixed-dose , placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo .
In two 12-week , placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-week , placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder , with or without psychotic features , who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels , the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy .
102 In a 26-week , placebo-controlled trial , followed by a 74-week extension , in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization , aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence , primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression .
Aripiprazole solution for injection administered intramuscularly as a single-dose to healthy subjects is well absorbed and has an absolute bioavailability of 100 % .
The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90 % greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations .
In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing .
Aripiprazole is widely distributed throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg , indicating extensive extravascular distribution .
At therapeutic concentrations , aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99 % bound to serum proteins , binding primarily to albumin .
Aripiprazole is extensively metabolised by the liver primarily by three biotransformation pathways : dehydrogenation , hydroxylation , and N-dealkylation .
Based on in vitro studies , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole , and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4 .
Aripiprazole is the predominant medicinal product moiety in systemic circulation .
At steady state , dehydro-aripiprazole , the active metabolite , represents about 40 % of aripiprazole AUC in plasma .
The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6 .
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 ml/ min/ kg , which is primarily hepatic .
Following a single oral dose of [ 14C]-labelled aripiprazole , approximately 27 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60 % in the faeces .
Less than 1 % of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18 % was recovered unchanged in the faeces .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and younger adult subjects , nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients .
Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole .
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects .
A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis ( Child-Pugh Classes A , B , and C ) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole , but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
Administration of aripiprazole solution for injection was well tolerated and produced no direct target organ toxicity in rats or monkeys after repeated dosing at systemic exposures ( AUC ) that were 15 and 5 times , respectively , human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramuscular .
In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies , no new safety concerns were observed at maternal exposures up to 15 ( rat ) and 29 ( rabbit ) times human exposure at 30 mg .
Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional oral aripiprazole studies of safety pharmacology , repeat-dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , and toxicity to reproduction .
Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure , indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use .
These included : dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity ( lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day ( 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose ) .
The highest nontumorigenic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose 2 or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m ) .
However , the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed , 30 mg per day , were no more than 6 % of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below ( 6 % ) their limits of in vitro solubility .
Based on results of a full range of standard genotoxicity tests , aripiprazole was considered non-genotoxic .
Developmental toxicity , including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects , were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures ( based on AUC ) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose .
Maternal toxicity occurred at doses similar to those eliciting developmental toxicity .
