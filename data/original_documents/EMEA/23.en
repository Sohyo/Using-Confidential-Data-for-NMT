Actraphane 30 40 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a vial .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 40 IU of insulin human .
1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 400 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
2 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
3 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
4 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
Studien haben eine t½ von etwa 5-10 Stunden ergeben . Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
20 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/ RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION
Actraphane 20 Penfill 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a cartridge .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 20 consists of 20 % dissolved insulin and 80 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
23 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk delivery systems ( durable devices for repeated use ) and NovoFine needles .
Detailed instruction accompanying the delivery system must be followed .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
24 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
25 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .

1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 40 consists of 40 % dissolved insulin and 60 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
37 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk delivery systems ( durable devices for repeated use ) and NovoFine needles .
Detailed instruction accompanying the delivery system must be followed .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
38 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
39 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
Studien haben eine t½ von etwa 5-10 Stunden ergeben . Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
53 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
55 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/ RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION
Actraphane 20 NovoLet 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 20 consists of 20 % dissolved insulin and 80 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
58 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Actraphane NovoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine needles .
NovoLet delivers 2-78 units in increments of 2 units .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
59 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .

DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/ RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION
Actraphane 40 NovoLet 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 40 consists of 40 % dissolved insulin and 60 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
72 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Actraphane NovoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine needles .
NovoLet delivers 2-78 units in increments of 2 units .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
73 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
74 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
76 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
87 As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
88 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Die Häufigkeiten von unerwünschten Arzneimittelwirkungen , die in klinischen Studien beobachtet und mit Actraphane in Zusammenhang gebracht wurden , sind unten dargestellt . The frequencies are defined as :
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
90 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Actraphane 30 FlexPen 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
93 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Actraphane FlexPen is designed to be used with NovoFine short cap needles of 8 mm or shorter in length .
The needle box is marked with an S.
FlexPen delivers 1-60 units in increments of 1 unit .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
94 As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using your insulin . Keep this leaflet .
You may need to read it again . If you have any further questions , ask your doctor , diabetes nurse or your pharmacist . This medicine has been prescribed for you .
It may harm them , even if their symptoms are the same as yours . If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , diabetes nurse or your pharmacist .
WHAT ACTRAPHANE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Actraphane is human insulin to treat diabetes .
Actraphane is a mixture of fast-acting insulin and long-acting insulin .
This means that it will start to lower your blood sugar about half an hour after you take it , and the effect will last for approximately 24 hours .
If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to this insulin product , metacresol or any of the other ingredients ( see 7 Further information ) .
Look out for the signs of allergy in 5 Possible side effects If you feel a hypo coming on ( a hypo is short for a hypoglycaemic reaction and is a symptom of low blood sugar ) .
See 4 What to do in an emergency for more about hypos .
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver , or with your adrenal , pituitary or thyroid glands If you are drinking alcohol : watch for signs of a hypo and never drink alcohol on an empty stomach If you are exercising more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet If you are ill : carry on taking your insulin If you are going abroad : travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing of your injections .
Many medicines affect the way glucose works in your body and they may influence your insulin dose .
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment .
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you take or have recently taken any other medicines , even those not prescribed .
Your need for insulin may change if you also take : oral antidiabetic products ; monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) ; beta-blockers ; ACE-inhibitors ; acetylsalicylic acid ; anabolic steroids ; sulphonamides ; oral contraceptives ; thiazides ; glucocorticoids ; thyroid hormone therapy ; beta- sympathomimetics ; growth hormone ; danazol ; octreotide or lanreotide .
If you are pregnant , planning a pregnancy or breast-feeding : please contact your doctor for advice .
If you drive or use tools or machines : watch out for signs of a hypo .
Your ability to concentrate or to react will be less during a hypo .
Never drive or use machinery if you feel a hypo coming on .
Discuss with your doctor whether you can drive or use machines at all , if you have a lot of hypos or if you find it hard to recognise hypos .
Talk about your insulin needs with your doctor and diabetes nurse .
This leaflet is a general guide .
If your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another , your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor .
Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection .
It is recommended that you measure your blood glucose regularly .
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab .
In insulin infusion pumps If the protective cap is loose or missing .
Each vial has a protective , tamper-proof plastic cap.
If it isn t in perfect condition when you get the vial , return the vial to your supplier If it hasn t been stored correctly or been frozen ( see 6 How to store Actraphane ) If it s not uniformly white and cloudy when it s resuspended .
Actraphane is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
Never inject your insulin directly into a vein or muscle .
Always vary the sites you inject , to avoid lumps ( see 5 Possible side effects ) .
The best places to give yourself an injection are : the front of your waist ( abdomen ) ; your buttocks ; the front of your thighs or upper arms .
Your insulin will work more quickly if you inject it around the waist .
Actraphane vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale .
Roll the vial between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white and cloudy .
Resuspending is easier if the insulin has reached room temperature 2.
Draw air into the syringe , in the same amount as the dose of insulin you need 3.
Inject the air into the vial : push the needle through the rubber stopper and press the plunger 4.
Turn the vial and syringe upside down 5.
Draw the right dose of insulin into the syringe 6.
Pull the needle out of the vial 7.
Make sure there is no air left in the syringe : point the needle upwards and push the air out 8.
Check you have the right dose 9.
Inject the insulin under the skin .
Verwenden Sie die Injektionstechnik , die Ihnen Ihr Arzt oder Ihre Diabetesberaterin empfohlen hat Lassen Sie die Injektionsnadel mindestens 6 Sekunden lang unter Ihrer Haut , um sicherzustellen , dass die vollständige Dosis injiziert wurde . 156 Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that the full dose has been delivered .
A hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
The warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include : cold sweat ; cool pale skin ; headache ; rapid heart beat ; feeling sick ; feeling very hungry ; temporary changes in vision ; drowsiness ; unusual tiredness and weakness ; nervousness or tremor ; feeling anxious ; feeling confused ; difficulty in concentrating .
If you get any of these signs , eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack ( sweets , biscuits , fruit juice ) , then rest .
Don t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on .
Carry glucose tablets , sweets , biscuits or fruit juice with you , just in case .
Tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that if you pass out ( become unconscious ) , they must : turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away .
They must not give you any food or drink as it could choke you . If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated , it can cause brain damage ( temporary or permanent ) and even death If you have a hypo that makes you pass out , or a lot of hypos , talk to your doctor .
The amount or timing of insulin , food or exercise may need to be adjusted .
You may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it .
If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack as soon as you are conscious .
If you do not respond to glucagon treatment , you will have to be treated in a hospital .
Seek medical advice after an injection of glucagon ; you need to find the reason for your hypo to avoid getting more .
You get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low .
This might happen : If you take too much insulin If you eat too little or miss a meal If you exercise more than usual .
Your blood sugar may get too high ( this is called hyperglycaemia ) .
They include : increased urination ; feeling thirsty ; losing your appetite ; feeling sick ( nausea or vomiting ) ; feeling drowsy or tired ; flushed , dry skin ; dry mouth and a fruity ( acetone ) smell of the breath .
If you get any of these signs and test your blood sugar level ; test your urine for ketones if you can .
Then seek medical advice straight away .
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .
If you don t treat it , this could lead to diabetic coma and death .
Having forgotten to take your insulin Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need An infection or a fever
Like all medicines , Actraphane can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
Actraphane may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) .
See the advice in 4 What to do in an emergency .
Side effects reported uncommonly ( in less than 1 patient in 100 )
Changes at the injection site ( Lipodystrophy ) .
If you inject yourself too often at the same site , fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink ( lipoatrophy ) or thicken ( lipohypertrophy ) .
Changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes .
If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site , tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe , or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site .
Reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) at the injection site may occur ( local allergic reactions ) .
These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin .
If they do not disappear , see your doctor .
Seek medical advice immediately : if signs of allergy spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel unwell and you start sweating ; start being sick ( vomiting ) ; have difficulty in breathing ; have a rapid heart beat ; feel dizzy ; feel like fainting .
You may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients ( called a systemic allergic reaction ) .
See also warning in 2 Before you use Actraphane .
172 Diabetische Retinopathie ( Veränderungen des Augenhintergrundes ) Wenn Sie an diabetischer Retinopathie leiden und sich Ihre Blutzuckerwerte sehr rasch bessern , kann sich die Retinopathie verschlimmern . If you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood glucose levels improve very fast , the retinopathy may get worse .
When you start taking insulin , water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints .
Schmerzhafte Neuropathie ( Nervenschmerzen ) Wenn sich Ihre Blutzuckerwerte sehr rasch bessern , können brennende , kribbelnde Schmerzen auftreten - dies wird als akute schmerzhafte Neuropathie bezeichnet und ist normalerweise vorübergehender Natur . This is called acute painful neuropathy and it usually disappears .
If it does not disappear , see your doctor .
Side effects reported very rarely(in less than 1 patient in 10,000 )

WHAT ACTRAPHANE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Actraphane is human insulin to treat diabetes .
Actraphane is a mixture of fast-acting insulin and long-acting insulin .
This means that it will start to lower your blood sugar about half an hour after you take it , and the effect will last for approximately 24 hours .
If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to this insulin product , metacresol or any of the other ingredients ( see 7 Further information ) .
Look out for the signs of allergy in 5 Possible side effects If you feel a hypo coming on ( a hypo is short for a hypoglycaemic reaction and is a symptom of low blood sugar ) .
See 4 What to do in an emergency for more about hypos .
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver , or with your adrenal , pituitary or thyroid glands If you are drinking alcohol : watch for signs of a hypo and never drink alcohol on an empty stomach If you are exercising more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet If you are ill : carry on taking your insulin If you are going abroad : travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing of your injections .
Many medicines affect the way glucose works in your body and they may influence your insulin dose .
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment .
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you take or have recently taken any other medicines , even those not prescribed .
Your need for insulin may change if you also take : oral antidiabetic products ; monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) ; beta-blockers ; ACE-inhibitors ; acetylsalicylic acid ; anabolic steroids ; sulphonamides ; oral contraceptives ; thiazides ; glucocorticoids ; thyroid hormone therapy ; beta- sympathomimetics ; growth hormone ; danazol ; octreotide or lanreotide .
If you are pregnant , planning a pregnancy or breast-feeding : please contact your doctor for advice .
If you drive or use tools or machines : watch out for signs of a hypo .
Your ability to concentrate or to react will be less during a hypo .
Never drive or use machinery if you feel a hypo coming on .
Discuss with your doctor whether you can drive or use machines at all , if you have a lot of hypos or if you find it hard to recognise hypos .
Talk about your insulin needs with your doctor and diabetes nurse .
This leaflet is a general guide .
If your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another , your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor .
Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection .
It is recommended that you measure your blood glucose regularly .
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab .
In insulin infusion pumps If the protective cap is loose or missing .
Each vial has a protective , tamper-proof plastic cap.
If it isn t in perfect condition when you get the vial , return the vial to your supplier If it hasn t been stored correctly or been frozen ( see 6 How to store Actraphane ) If it s not uniformly white and cloudy when it s resuspended .
Actraphane is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
Never inject your insulin directly into a vein or muscle .
Always vary the sites you inject , to avoid lumps ( see 5 Possible side effects ) .
The best places to give yourself an injection are : the front of your waist ( abdomen ) ; your buttocks ; the front of your thighs or upper arms .
Your insulin will work more quickly if you inject it around the waist .
Actraphane vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale .
Roll the vial between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white and cloudy .
Resuspending is easier if the insulin has reached room temperature 2.
Draw air into the syringe , in the same amount as the dose of insulin you need 3.
Inject the air into the vial : push the needle through the rubber stopper and press the plunger 4.
Turn the vial and syringe upside down 5.
Draw the right dose of insulin into the syringe 6.
Pull the needle out of the vial 7.
Make sure there is no air left in the syringe : point the needle upwards and push the air out 8.
Check you have the right dose 9.
Inject the insulin under the skin .
Verwenden Sie die Injektionstechnik , die Ihnen Ihr Arzt oder Ihre Diabetesberaterin empfohlen hat Lassen Sie die Injektionsnadel mindestens 6 Sekunden lang unter Ihrer Haut , um sicherzustellen , dass die vollständige Dosis injiziert wurde . 161 Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that the full dose has been delivered .
A hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
The warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include : cold sweat ; cool pale skin ; headache ; rapid heart beat ; feeling sick ; feeling very hungry ; temporary changes in vision ; drowsiness ; unusual tiredness and weakness ; nervousness or tremor ; feeling anxious ; feeling confused ; difficulty in concentrating .
If you get any of these signs , eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack ( sweets , biscuits , fruit juice ) , then rest .
Don t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on .
Carry glucose tablets , sweets , biscuits or fruit juice with you , just in case .
Tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that if you pass out ( become unconscious ) , they must : turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away .
They must not give you any food or drink as it could choke you . If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated , it can cause brain damage ( temporary or permanent ) and even death If you have a hypo that makes you pass out , or a lot of hypos , talk to your doctor .
The amount or timing of insulin , food or exercise may need to be adjusted .
You may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it .
If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack as soon as you are conscious .
If you do not respond to glucagon treatment , you will have to be treated in a hospital .
Seek medical advice after an injection of glucagon ; you need to find the reason for your hypo to avoid getting more .
You get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low .
This might happen : If you take too much insulin If you eat too little or miss a meal If you exercise more than usual .
Your blood sugar may get too high ( this is called hyperglycaemia ) .
They include : increased urination ; feeling thirsty ; losing your appetite ; feeling sick ( nausea or vomiting ) ; feeling drowsy or tired ; flushed , dry skin ; dry mouth and a fruity ( acetone ) smell of the breath .
If you get any of these signs , test your blood sugar level and test your urine for ketones if you can .
Then seek medical advice straight away .
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .
If you don t treat it , this could lead to diabetic coma and death .
Having forgotten to take your insulin Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need An infection or a fever
Like all medicines , Actraphane can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
Actraphane may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) .
See the advice in 4 What to do in an emergency .
Side effects reported uncommonly ( in less than 1 patient in 100 )
Changes at the injection site ( Lipodystrophy ) .
If you inject yourself too often at the same site , fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink ( lipoatrophy ) or thicken ( lipohypertrophy ) .
Changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes .
If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site , tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe , or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site .
Reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) at the injection site may occur ( local allergic reactions ) .
These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin .
If they do not disappear , see your doctor .
Seek medical advice immediately : if signs of allergy spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel unwell and you start sweating ; start being sick ( vomiting ) ; have difficulty in breathing ; have a rapid heart beat ; feel dizzy ; feel like fainting .
You may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients ( called a systemic allergic reaction ) .
See also warning in 2 Before you use Actraphane .
Diabetic retinopathy ( eye background changes ) .
If you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood glucose levels improve very fast , the retinopathy may get worse .
When you start taking insulin , water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints .
Schmerzhafte Neuropathie ( Nervenschmerzen ) Wenn sich Ihre Blutzuckerwerte sehr rasch bessern , können brennende , kribbelnde Schmerzen auftreten - dies wird als akute schmerzhafte Neuropathie bezeichnet und ist normalerweise vorübergehender Natur . This is called acute painful neuropathy and it usually disappears .
If it does not disappear , see your doctor .
Side effects reported very rarely ( in less than 1 patient in 10,000 )
When you first start your treatment , it may disturb your vision , but the reaction usually disappears .
If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , diabetes nurse or pharmacist .

Do not refill Actraphane 10 Penfill .
Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine needles .
If you are treated with Actraphane 10 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge , you should use two insulin delivery systems , one for each type of insulin .
Resuspending is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature .
Before you put the Penfill cartridge into the insulin delivery system , move it up and down between positions a and b and back ( see the picture ) so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times .
Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection .
The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy .
Complete the other stages of injection without delay .
166 Check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow even resuspending .
If there are less than 12 units left , use a new one .
Actraphane is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using your insulin . Keep this leaflet .
You may need to read it again . If you have any further questions , ask your doctor , diabetes nurse or your pharmacist . This medicine has been prescribed for you .
It may harm them , even if their symptoms are the same as yours . If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , diabetes nurse or your pharmacist .
WHAT ACTRAPHANE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Actraphane is human insulin to treat diabetes .
Actraphane is a mixture of fast-acting insulin and long-acting insulin .
This means that it will start to lower your blood sugar about half an hour after you take it , and the effect will last for approximately 24 hours .
If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to this insulin product , metacresol or any of the other ingredients ( see 7 Further information ) .
Look out for the signs of allergy in 5 Possible side effects If you feel a hypo coming on ( a hypo is short for a hypoglycaemic reaction and is a symptom of low blood sugar ) .
See 4 What to do in an emergency for more about hypos .
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver , or with your adrenal , pituitary or thyroid glands If you are drinking alcohol : watch for signs of a hypo and never drink alcohol on an empty stomach If you are exercising more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet If you are ill : carry on taking your insulin If you are going abroad : travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing of your injections .
Many medicines affect the way glucose works in your body and they may influence your insulin dose .
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment .
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you take or have recently taken any other medicines , even those not prescribed .
Your need for insulin may change if you also take : oral antidiabetic products ; monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) ; beta-blockers ; ACE-inhibitors ; acetylsalicylic acid ; anabolic steroids ; sulphonamides ; oral contraceptives ; thiazides ; glucocorticoids ; thyroid hormone therapy ; beta- sympathomimetics ; growth hormone ; danazol ; octreotide or lanreotide .
If you are pregnant , planning a pregnancy or breast-feeding : please contact your doctor for advice .
If you drive or use tools or machines : watch out for signs of a hypo .
Your ability to concentrate or to react will be less during a hypo .
Never drive or use machinery if you feel a hypo coming on .
Discuss with your doctor whether you can drive or use machines at all , if you have a lot of hypos or if you find it hard to recognise hypos .
Talk about your insulin needs with your doctor and diabetes nurse .
This leaflet is a general guide .
If your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another , your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor .
Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection .
It is recommended that you measure your blood glucose regularly .
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin Always check the cartridge , including the rubber plunger ( stopper ) .
Don t use it if any damage is seen or if there is a gap between the rubber plunger and the white label band .
Take it back to your supplier .
See your delivery system manual for further instructions Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab Always use a new needle for each injection to prevent contamination .
In insulin infusion pumps If Penfill or the device containing Penfill is dropped , damaged or crushed there is a risk of leakage of insulin If it hasn t been stored correctly or been frozen ( see 6 How to store Actraphane ) If it s not uniformly white and cloudy when it s resuspended .
Do not refill Actraphane 30 Penfill .
Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine needles .
If you are treated with Actraphane 30 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge , you should use two insulin delivery systems , one for each type of insulin .
Resuspending is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature .
Before you put the Penfill cartridge into the insulin delivery system , move it up and down between positions a and b and back ( see the picture ) so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times .
Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection .
The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy .
Complete the other stages of injection without delay .
176 Check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow even resuspending .
If there are less than 12 units left , use a new one .
Actraphane is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
Never inject your insulin directly into a vein or muscle .
Always vary the sites you inject , to avoid lumps ( see 5 Possible side effects ) .
The best places to give yourself an injection are : the front of your waist ( abdomen ) ; your buttocks ; the front of your thighs or upper arms .
Your insulin will work more quickly if you inject it around the waist .
Inject the insulin under the skin .
Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or diabetes nurse and described in your delivery system manual Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that the full dose has been delivered After each injection be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actraphane without the needle attached .
Otherwise , the liquid may leak out which can cause inaccurate dossing .
A hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
The warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include : cold sweat ; cool pale skin ; headache ; rapid heart beat ; feeling sick ; feeling very hungry ; temporary changes in vision ; drowsiness ; unusual tiredness and weakness ; nervousness or tremor ; feeling anxious ; feeling confused ; difficulty in concentrating .
If you get any of these signs , eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack ( sweets , biscuits , fruit juice ) , then rest .
Don t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on .
Carry glucose tablets , sweets , biscuits or fruit juice with you , just in case .
Tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that if you pass out ( become unconscious ) , they must : turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away .
They must not give you any food or drink as it could choke you . If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated , it can cause brain damage ( temporary or permanent ) and even death If you have a hypo that makes you pass out , or a lot of hypos , talk to your doctor .
The amount or timing of insulin , food or exercise may need to be adjusted .
You may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it .
If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack as soon as you are conscious .
If you do not respond to glucagon treatment , you will have to be treated in a hospital .
Seek medical advice after an injection of glucagon ; you need to find the reason for your hypo to avoid getting more .
You get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low .
This might happen : If you take too much insulin If you eat too little or miss a meal If you exercise more than usual .
Your blood sugar may get too high ( this is called hyperglycaemia ) .
They include : increased urination ; feeling thirsty ; losing your appetite ; feeling sick ( nausea or vomiting ) ; feeling drowsy or tired ; flushed , dry skin ; dry mouth and a fruity ( acetone ) smell of the breath .
If you get any of these signs , test your blood sugar level and test your urine for ketones if you can .
Then seek medical advice straight away .
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .
If you don t treat it , this could lead to diabetic coma and death .
Having forgotten to take your insulin Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need An infection or a fever Eating more than usual Less exercise than usual .
Like all medicines , Actraphane can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
Actraphane may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) .
See the advice in 4 What to do in an emergency .
Side effects reported uncommonly ( in less than 1 patient in 100 )
Changes at the injection site ( Lipodystrophy ) .
If you inject yourself too often at the same site , fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink ( lipoatrophy ) or thicken ( lipohypertrophy ) .
Changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes .
If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site , tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe , or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site .
Reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) at the injection site may occur ( local allergic reactions ) .
These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin .
If they do not disappear , see your doctor .
Seek medical advice immediately : if signs of allergy spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel unwell and you start sweating ; start being sick ( vomiting ) ; have difficulty in breathing ; have a rapid heart beat ; feel dizzy ; feel like fainting .
You may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients ( called a systemic allergic reaction ) .
See also warning in 2 Before you use Actraphane .
Diabetische Retinopathie ( Veränderungen des Augenhintergrundes ) Wenn Sie an diabetischer Retinopathie leiden und sich Ihre Blutzuckerwerte sehr rasch bessern , kann sich die Retinopathie verschlimmern . If you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood glucose levels improve very fast , the retinopathy may get worse .
When you start taking insulin , water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints .
Schmerzhafte Neuropathie ( Nervenschmerzen ) Wenn sich Ihre Blutzuckerwerte sehr rasch bessern , können brennende , kribbelnde Schmerzen auftreten - dies wird als akute schmerzhafte Neuropathie bezeichnet und ist normalerweise vorübergehender Natur . This is called acute painful neuropathy and it usually disappears .
If it does not disappear , see your doctor .
Side effects reported very rarely ( in less than 1 patient in 10,000 )
When you first start your treatment , it may disturb your vision , but the reaction usually disappears .
178 If any of the side effects gets serious , or if you notice any side effects a not listed in this leaflet , please tell your doctor , diabetes nurse or pharmacist .

1 ml contains 40 IU of insulin human .
1 vial contains 10 ml equivalent to 400 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
2 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The vials are for use with insulin syringes with a corresponding unit scale .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
3 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
4 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
Studien haben eine t½ von etwa 5-10 Stunden ergeben . Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .

This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
11 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
13 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/ RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION
Actraphane 10 Penfill 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a cartridge .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 10 consists of 10 % dissolved insulin and 90 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
16 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk delivery systems ( durable devices for repeated use ) and NovoFine needles .
Detailed instruction accompanying the delivery system must be followed .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
17 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .

Actraphane 30 Penfill 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a cartridge .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 cartridge contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
30 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
The cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk delivery systems ( durable devices for repeated use ) and NovoFine needles .
Detailed instruction accompanying the delivery system must be followed .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
31 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
32 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
34 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .

After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of
46 hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
Studien haben eine t½ von etwa 5-10 Stunden ergeben . Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/ RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION
Actraphane 10 NovoLet 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 10 consists of 10 % dissolved insulin and 90 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
51 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Actraphane NovoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine needles .
NovoLet delivers 2-78 units in increments of 2 units .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
52 As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .

DATE OF FIRST AUTHORISATION/ RENEWAL OF THE AUTHORISATION
Actraphane 30 NovoLet 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
65 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Actraphane NovoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine needles .
NovoLet delivers 2-78 units in increments of 2 units .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
66 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
67 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
69 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to
80 reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
On rare occasions , injection site reactions may require discontinuation of Actraphane .
A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin .
Before travelling between different time zones , the patient should be advised to consult the physician , since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times .
Insulin suspensions are not to be used in insulin infusion pumps .
Actraphane contains metacresol , which may cause allergic reactions .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
A number of medicinal products are known to interact with glucose metabolism .
The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take .
The following substances may reduce insulin requirement :
Oral hypoglycaemic agents ( OHA ) , monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) , non-selective beta- blocking agents , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , salicylates , alcohol , anabolic steroids and sulphonamides .
The following substances may increase insulin requirement :
Oral contraeptives , thiazides , glucocorticoids , thyroid hormones and beta-sympathomimetics , growth hormone and danazol .
Beta-blocking agents may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia .
Octreotide/ lanreotide may both decrease and increase insulin requirement .
Alcohol may intensify and prolong the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin .
There are no restrictions on treatment of diabetes with insulin during pregnancy , as insulin does not pass the placental barrier .
Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia , which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of malformations and death in utero .
Intensified control in the treatment of pregnant women with diabetes is therefore recommended throughout pregnancy and when contemplating pregnancy .
Insulin requirements usually fall in the first trimester and subsequently increase during the second and third trimesters .
After delivery , insulin requirements return rapidly to pre-pregnancy values .
Insulin treatment of the nursing mother presents no risk to the baby .
However , the Actraphane dosage may need to be adjusted .
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
The patient s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia .
This may constitute a risk in situations where these abilities are of special importance ( e. g. driving a car or operating machinery ) .
81 Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving .
This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning signs of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia .
The advisability of driving should be considered in these circumstances .
As for other insulin products , in general , hypoglycaemia is the most frequently occurring undesirable effect .
It may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement .
In clinical trials and during marketed use , the frequency varies with patient population and dose regimens .
Therefore , no specific frequency can be presented .
Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death .
Frequencies of adverse drug reactions from clinical trials that are considered related to Actraphane are listed below .
Die Häufigkeiten sind definiert als : gelegentlich ( 1/1.000 , < 1/100 ) ; Einzelfälle sind als sehr selten ( < 1/10.000 ) einschließlich gemeldeter Einzelfälle dargestellt . Isolated spontaneous cases are presented as very rare defined as < 1/ 10,000 including isolated reports .
Within each frequency grouping , undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed acute painful neuropathy , which is usually reversible .
Eye disorders Very rare - Refraction disorders Refraction anomalies may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
These symptoms are usually of transitory nature .
Uncommon - Diabetic retinopathy Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy .
However , intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area .
General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions ( redness , swelling , itching , pain and haematoma at the injection site ) may occur during treatment with insulin .
Most reactions are transitory and disappear during continued treatment .
Uncommon - Oedema Oedema may occur upon initiation of insulin therapy .
Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria , rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash , itching , sweating , gastrointestinal upset , angioneurotic oedema , difficulties in breathing , palpitation , reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness .
A specific overdose of insulin cannot be defined .
However , hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages : Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products .
It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps , sweets , biscuits or sugary fruit juice . Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of
Studien haben eine t½ von etwa 5-10 Stunden ergeben . Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

Actraphane 30 InnoLet 100 IU/ ml suspension for injection in a pre-filled pen .
Insulin human , rDNA ( produced by recombinant DNA technology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) .
1 ml contains 100 IU of insulin human .
1 pre-filled pen contains 3 ml equivalent to 300 IU .
One IU ( International Unit ) corresponds to 0.035 mg of anhydrous human insulin .
Actraphane is a mixture of dissolved insulin and isophane ( NPH ) insulin .
Actraphane 30 consists of 30 % dissolved insulin and 70 % isophane insulin .
For a full list of excipients , see section 6.1 .
Cloudy , white , aqueous suspension .
It is biphasic formulation containing both fast-acting and long- acting insulin .
Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired .
Dosage Dosage is individual and determined in accordance with the needs of the patient .
The individual insulin requirement is usually between 0.3 and 1.0 IU/ kg/ day .
The daily insulin requirement may be higher in patients with insulin resistance ( e. g. during puberty or due to obesity ) and lower in patients with residual , endogenous insulin production .
In patients with diabetes mellitus optimised glycaemic control delays the onset of late diabetic complications .
Close blood glucose monitoring is therefore recommended .
An injection should be followed within 30 minutes by a meal or snack containing carbohydrates .
Dosage adjustment Concomitant illness , especially infections and feverish conditions , usually increases the patient 's insulin requirement .
Renal or hepatic impairment may reduce insulin requirement .
86 Adjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients change physical activity or their usual diet .
Dosage adjustment may be necessary when transferring patients from one insulin preparation to another ( see section 4.4 ) .
Insulin suspensions are never to be administered intravenously .
Actraphane is administered subcutaneously in the thigh or abdominal wall .
If convenient , the gluteal region or the deltoid region may also be used .
Subcutaneous injection into the abdominal wall ensures a faster absorption than from other injection sites .
Injection into a lifted skin fold minimises the risk of unintended intramuscular injection .
The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected .
Injection sites should be rotated within an anatomic region in order to avoid lipodystrophy .
Actraphane InnoLet is designed to be used with NovoFine short cap needles of 8 mm or shorter in length .
The needle box is marked with an S.
InnoLet delivers 1-50 units in increments of 1 unit .
The pens should be primed before injection so that the dose selector returns to zero and a drop of insulin appears at the needle top .
The dose is set by turning the selector , which returns to zero during the injection .
Actraphane is accompanied by a package leaflet with detailed instruction for use to be followed .
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients ( see section 6.1 ) .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment , especially in type 1 diabetes , may lead to hyperglycaemia .
Die ersten Symptome einer Hyperglykämie , wie Durstgefühl , verstärkter Harndrang , Übelkeit , Erbrechen , Benommenheit , gerötete trockene Haut , Mundtrockenheit , Appetitverlust sowie nach Aceton riechender Atem , treten in der Regel allmählich über Stunden bzw. Tage auf . They include thirst , increased frequency of urination , nausea , vomiting , drowsiness , flushed dry skin , dry mouth , loss of appetite as well as acetone odour of breath .
In type 1 diabetes , untreated hyperglycaemic events eventually lead to diabetic ketoacidosis , which is potentially lethal .
Hypoglycaemia may occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement ( see sections 4.8 and 4.9 ) .
Omission of a meal or unplanned , strenuous physical exercise may lead to hypoglycaemia .
Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy , may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly .
Usual warning symptoms may disappear in patients with longstanding diabetes .
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision .
Changes in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , type ( fast- , dual- , long-acting insulin etc. ) , origin ( animal , human or analogue insulin ) and/ or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may result in a need for a change in dosage .
If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane , it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months .
87 As with any insulin therapy , injection site reactions may occur and include pain , itching , hives , swelling and inflammation .
Continuous rotation of the injection site within a given area may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
Reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .

Severe hypoglycaemic episodes , where the patient has become unconscious , can be treated by glucagon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction , or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional .
Glucose must also be given intravenously , if the patient does not respond to glucagon within 10 to 15 minutes .
Upon regaining consciousness , administration of oral carbohydrate is recommended for the patient in order to prevent relapse .
Insulins and analogues for injection , intermediate-acting combined with fast-acting , insulin ( human ) .
The blood glucose lowering effect of insulin is due to the facilitated uptake of glucose following binding of insulin to receptors on muscle and fat cells and to the simultaneous inhibition of glucose output from the liver .
Onset of action is within ½ hour , reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours .
Insulin in the blood stream has a half-life of a few minutes .
Consequently , the time-action profile of an insulin preparation is determined solely by its absorption characteristics .
This process is influenced by several factors ( e. g. insulin dosage , injection route and site , thickness of subcutaneous fat , type of diabetes ) .
The pharmacokinetics of insulin products are therefore affected by significant intra- and inter-individual variation .
Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively .
The maximum plasma concentration of the fast-acting insulin is reached within 1.5-2.5 hours after subcutaneous administration .
Distribution No profound binding to plasma proteins , except circulating insulin antibodies ( if present ) has been observed .
Metabolism Human insulin is reported to be degraded by insulin protease or insulin-degrading enzymes and possibly protein disulfide isomerase .
A number of cleavage ( hydrolysis ) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed ; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active .
97 Elimination The terminal half-life is determined by the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous tissue .
The terminal half-life ( t½ ) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma ( insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes ) .
Trials have indicated a t½ of about 5-10 hours .
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , carcinogenic potential , toxicity to reproduction .

WHAT ACTRAPHANE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Actraphane is human insulin to treat diabetes .
Actraphane is a mixture of fast-acting insulin and long-acting insulin .
This means that it will start to lower your blood sugar about half an hour after you take it , and the effect will last for approximately 24 hours .
If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to this insulin product , metacresol or any of the other ingredients ( see 7 Further information ) .
Look out for the signs of allergy in 5 Possible side effects If you feel a hypo coming on ( a hypo is short for a hypoglycaemic reaction and is a symptom of low blood sugar ) .
See 4 What to do in an emergency for more about hypos .
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver , or with your adrenal , pituitary or thyroid glands If you are drinking alcohol : watch for signs of a hypo and never drink alcohol on an empty stomach If you are exercising more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet If you are ill : carry on taking your insulin If you are going abroad : travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing of your injections .
Many medicines affect the way glucose works in your body and they may influence your insulin dose .
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment .
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you take or have recently taken any other medicines , even those not prescribed .
Your need for insulin may change if you also take : oral antidiabetic products ; monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) ; beta-blockers ; ACE-inhibitors ; acetylsalicylic acid ; anabolic steroids ; sulphonamides ; oral contraceptives ; thiazides ; glucocorticoids ; thyroid hormone therapy ; beta- sympathomimetics ; growth hormone ; danazol ; octreotide or lanreotide .
If you are pregnant , planning a pregnancy or breast-feeding : please contact your doctor for advice .
If you drive or use tools or machines : watch out for signs of a hypo .
Your ability to concentrate or to react will be less during a hypo .
Never drive or use machinery if you feel a hypo coming on .
Discuss with your doctor whether you can drive or use machines at all , if you have a lot of hypos or if you find it hard to recognise hypos .
Talk about your insulin needs with your doctor and diabetes nurse .
This leaflet is a general guide .
If your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another , your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor .
Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection .
It is recommended that you measure your blood glucose regularly .
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab .
In insulin infusion pumps If the protective cap is loose or missing .
Each vial has a protective , tamper-proof plastic cap.
If it isn t in perfect condition when you get the vial , return the vial to your supplier If it hasn t been stored correctly or been frozen ( see 6 How to store Actraphane ) If it s not uniformly white and cloudy when it s resuspended .
Actraphane is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
Never inject your insulin directly into a vein or muscle .
Always vary the sites you inject , to avoid lumps ( see 5 Possible side effects ) .
The best places to give yourself an injection are : the front of your waist ( abdomen ) ; your buttocks ; the front of your thighs or upper arms .
Your insulin will work more quickly if you inject it around the waist .
Actraphane vials are for use with insulin syringes with the corresponding unit scale .
Roll the vial between your hands until the liquid is uniformly white and cloudy .
Resuspending is easier if the insulin has reached room temperature 2.
Draw air into the syringe , in the same amount as the dose of insulin you need 3.
Inject the air into the vial : push the needle through the rubber stopper and press the plunger 4.
Turn the vial and syringe upside down 5.
Draw the right dose of insulin into the syringe 6.
Pull the needle out of the vial 7.
Make sure there is no air left in the syringe : point the needle upwards and push the air out 8.
Check you have the right dose 9.
Inject the insulin under the skin .
Verwenden Sie die Injektionstechnik , die Ihnen Ihr Arzt oder Ihre Diabetesberaterin empfohlen hat Lassen Sie die Injektionsnadel mindestens 6 Sekunden lang unter Ihrer Haut , um sicherzustellen , dass die vollständige Dosis injiziert wurde . 156 Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that the full dose has been delivered .
A hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
The warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include : cold sweat ; cool pale skin ; headache ; rapid heart beat ; feeling sick ; feeling very hungry ; temporary changes in vision ; drowsiness ; unusual tiredness and weakness ; nervousness or tremor ; feeling anxious ; feeling confused ; difficulty in concentrating .
If you get any of these signs , eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack ( sweets , biscuits , fruit juice ) , then rest .
Don t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on .
Carry glucose tablets , sweets , biscuits or fruit juice with you , just in case .
Tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that if you pass out ( become unconscious ) , they must : turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away .
They must not give you any food or drink as it could choke you . If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated , it can cause brain damage ( temporary or permanent ) and even death If you have a hypo that makes you pass out , or a lot of hypos , talk to your doctor .
The amount or timing of insulin , food or exercise may need to be adjusted .
You may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it .
If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack as soon as you are conscious .
If you do not respond to glucagon treatment , you will have to be treated in a hospital .
Seek medical advice after an injection of glucagon ; you need to find the reason for your hypo to avoid getting more .
You get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low .
This might happen : If you take too much insulin If you eat too little or miss a meal If you exercise more than usual .
Your blood sugar may get too high ( this is called hyperglycaemia ) .
They include : increased urination ; feeling thirsty ; losing your appetite ; feeling sick ( nausea or vomiting ) ; feeling drowsy or tired ; flushed , dry skin ; dry mouth and a fruity ( acetone ) smell of the breath .
If you get any of these signs and test your blood sugar level ; test your urine for ketones if you can .
Then seek medical advice straight away .
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .
If you don t treat it , this could lead to diabetic coma and death .
Having forgotten to take your insulin Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need An infection or a fever
Like all medicines , Actraphane can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
Actraphane may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) .
See the advice in 4 What to do in an emergency .
Side effects reported uncommonly ( in less than 1 patient in 100 )
Changes at the injection site ( Lipodystrophy ) .
If you inject yourself too often at the same site , fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink ( lipoatrophy ) or thicken ( lipohypertrophy ) .
Changing the site with each injection may help to prevent such skin changes .
If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site , tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe , or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site .
Reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) at the injection site may occur ( local allergic reactions ) .
These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin .
If they do not disappear , see your doctor .
Seek medical advice immediately : if signs of allergy spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel unwell and you start sweating ; start being sick ( vomiting ) ; have difficulty in breathing ; have a rapid heart beat ; feel dizzy ; feel like fainting .
You may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients ( called a systemic allergic reaction ) .
See also warning in 2 Before you use Actraphane .

If you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood glucose levels improve very fast , the retinopathy may get worse .
When you start taking insulin , water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints .
Schmerzhafte Neuropathie ( Nervenschmerzen ) Wenn sich Ihre Blutzuckerwerte sehr rasch bessern , können brennende , kribbelnde Schmerzen auftreten - dies wird als akute schmerzhafte Neuropathie bezeichnet und ist normalerweise vorübergehender Natur . This is called acute painful neuropathy and it usually disappears .

If your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another , your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor .
Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection .
It is recommended that you measure your blood glucose regularly .
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin Always check the cartridge , including the rubber plunger ( stopper ) .
Don t use it if any damage is seen or if there is a gap between the rubber plunger and the white label band .
Take it back to your supplier .
See your delivery system manual for further instructions Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab Always use a new needle for each imjection to prevent contamination .
In insulin infusion pumps If Penfill or the device containing Penfill is dropped , damaged or crushed there is a risk of leakage of insulin If it hasn t been stored correctly or been frozen ( see 6 How to store Actraphane ) If it s not uniformly white and cloudy when it s resuspended .
Do not refill Actraphane 10 Penfill .
Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine needles .
If you are treated with Actraphane 10 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge , you should use two insulin delivery systems , one for each type of insulin .
Resuspending is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature .
Before you put the Penfill cartridge into the insulin delivery system , move it up and down between positions a and b and back ( see the picture ) so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times .
Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection .
The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy .
Complete the other stages of injection without delay .
166 Check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow even resuspending .
If there are less than 12 units left , use a new one .
Actraphane is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
Never inject your insulin directly into a vein or muscle .
Always vary the sites you inject , to avoid lumps ( see 5 Possible side effects ) .
The best places to give yourself an injection are : the front of your waist ( abdomen ) ; your buttocks ; the front of your thighs or upper arms .
Your insulin will work more quickly if you inject it around the waist .
Inject the insulin under the skin .
Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or diabetes nurse and described in your delivery system manual Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that the full dose has been delivered After each injection be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actraphane without the needle attached .
Otherwise , the liquid may leak out which can cause inaccurate dosing .
A hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
The warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include : cold sweat ; cool pale skin ; headache ; rapid heart beat ; feeling sick ; feeling very hungry ; temporary changes in vision ; drowsiness ; unusual tiredness and weakness ; nervousness or tremor ; feeling anxious ; feeling confused ; difficulty in concentrating .
If you get any of these signs , eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack ( sweets , biscuits , fruit juice ) , then rest .

If you notice your skin pitting or thickening at the injection site , tell your doctor or diabetes nurse because these reactions can become more severe , or they may change the absorption of your insulin if you inject in such a site .
Reactions ( redness , swelling , itching ) at the injection site may occur ( local allergic reactions ) .
These usually disappear after a few weeks of taking your insulin .
If they do not disappear , see your doctor .
Seek medical advice immediately : if signs of allergy spread to other parts of the body , or if you suddenly feel unwell and you start sweating ; start being sick ( vomiting ) ; have difficulty in breathing ; have a rapid heart beat ; feel dizzy ; feel like fainting .
You may have a very rare serious allergic reaction to Actraphane or one of its ingredients ( called a systemic allergic reaction ) .

If you have diabetic retinopathy and your blood glucose levels improve very fast , the retinopathy may get worse .
When you start taking insulin , water retention may cause swelling around your ankles and other joints .
Schmerzhafte Neuropathie ( Nervenschmerzen ) Wenn sich Ihre Blutzuckerwerte sehr rasch bessern , können brennende , kribbelnde Schmerzen auftreten - dies wird als akute schmerzhafte Neuropathie bezeichnet und ist normalerweise vorübergehender Natur .

WHAT ACTRAPHANE IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Actraphane is human insulin to treat diabetes .
Actraphane is a mixture of fast-acting insulin and long-acting insulin .
This means that it will start to lower your blood sugar about half an hour after you take it , and the effect will last for approximately 24 hours .
If you are allergic ( hypersensitive ) to this insulin product , metacresol or any of the other ingredients ( see 7 Further information ) .
Look out for the signs of allergy in 5 Possible side effects If you feel a hypo coming on ( a hypo is short for a hypoglycaemic reaction and is a symptom of low blood sugar ) .
See 4 What to do in an emergency for more about hypos .
If you have trouble with your kidneys or liver , or with your adrenal , pituitary or thyroid glands If you are drinking alcohol : watch for signs of a hypo and never drink alcohol on an empty stomach If you are exercising more than usual or if you want to change your usual diet If you are ill : carry on taking your insulin If you are going abroad : travelling over time zones may affect your insulin needs and the timing of your injections .
Many medicines affect the way glucose works in your body and they may influence your insulin dose .
Listed below are the most common medicines which may affect your insulin treatment .
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you take or have recently taken any other medicines , even those not prescribed .
Your need for insulin may change if you also take : oral antidiabetic products ; monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) ; beta-blockers ; ACE-inhibitors ; acetylsalicylic acid ; anabolic steroids ; sulphonamides ; oral contraceptives ; thiazides ; glucocorticoids ; thyroid hormone therapy ; beta- sympathomimetics ; growth hormone ; danazol ; octreotide or lanreotide .
If you are pregnant , planning a pregnancy or breast-feeding : please contact your doctor for advice .
If you drive or use tools or machines : watch out for signs of a hypo .
Your ability to concentrate or to react will be less during a hypo .
Never drive or use machinery if you feel a hypo coming on .
Discuss with your doctor whether you can drive or use machines at all , if you have a lot of hypos or if you find it hard to recognise hypos .
Talk about your insulin needs with your doctor and diabetes nurse .
This leaflet is a general guide .
If your doctor has switched you from one type or brand of insulin to another , your dose may have to be adjusted by your doctor .
Eat a meal or snack containing carbohydrates within 30 minutes of the injection .
It is recommended that you measure your blood glucose regularly .
Check the label to make sure it is the right type of insulin Always check the cartridge , including the rubber plunger ( stopper ) .
Don t use it if any damage is seen or if there is a gap between the rubber plunger and the white label band .
Take it back to your supplier .
See your delivery system manual for further instructions Disinfect the rubber membrane with a medicinal swab Always use a needle for each injection to prevent contamination
In insulin infusion pumps If Penfill or the device containing Penfill is dropped , damaged or crushed there is a risk of leakage of insulin If it hasn t been stored correctly or been frozen ( see 6 How to store Actraphane ) If it s not uniformly white and cloudy when it s resuspended .
Do not refill Actraphane 20 Penfill .
Penfill cartridges are designed to be used with Novo Nordisk insulin delivery systems and NovoFine needles .
If you are treated with Actraphane 20 Penfill and another insulin Penfill cartridge , you should use two insulin delivery systems , one for each type of insulin .
Resuspending is easier when the insulin has reached room temperature .
Before you put the Penfill cartridge into the insulin delivery system , move it up and down between positions a and b and back ( see the picture ) so that the glass ball moves from one end of the cartridge to the other at least 20 times .
Repeat this movement at least 10 times before each injection .
The movement must always be repeated until the liquid appears uniformly white and cloudy .
Complete the other stages of injection without delay .
171 Check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow even resuspending .
If there are less than 12 units left , use a new one .
Actraphane is for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
Never inject your insulin directly into a vein or muscle .
Always vary the sites you inject , to avoid lumps ( see 5 Possible side effects ) .
The best places to give yourself an injection are : the front of your waist ( abdomen ) ; your buttocks ; the front of your thighs or upper arms .
Your insulin will work more quickly if you inject around it the waist .
Inject the insulin under the skin .
Use the injection technique advised by your doctor or diabetes nurse and described in your delivery system manual Keep the needle under your skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure that the full dose has been delivered After each injection be sure to remove and discard the needle and store Actraphane without the needle attached .
Otherwise , the liquid may leak out which can cause inaccurate dossing .
A hypo means your blood sugar level is too low .
The warning signs of a hypo may come on suddenly and can include : cold sweat ; cool pale skin ; headache ; rapid heart beat ; feeling sick ; feeling very hungry ; temporary changes in vision ; drowsiness ; unusual tiredness and weakness ; nervousness or tremor ; feeling anxious ; feeling confused ; difficulty in concentrating .
If you get any of these signs , eat glucose tablets or a high sugar snack ( sweets , biscuits , fruit juice ) , then rest .
Don t take any insulin if you feel a hypo coming on .
Carry glucose tablets , sweets , biscuits or fruit juice with you , just in case .
Tell your relatives , friends and close colleagues that if you pass out ( become unconscious ) , they must : turn you on your side and seek medical advice straight away .
They must not give you any food or drink as it could choke you . If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated , it can cause brain damage ( temporary or permanent ) and even death If you have a hypo that makes you pass out , or a lot of hypos , talk to your doctor .
The amount or timing of insulin , food or exercise may need to be adjusted .
You may recover more quickly from unconsciousness with an injection of the hormone glucagon by someone who knows how to use it .
If you are given glucagon you will need glucose or a sugary snack as soon as you are conscious .
If you do not respond to glucagon treatment , you will have to be treated in a hospital .
Seek medical advice after an injection of glucagon ; you need to find the reason for your hypo to avoid getting more .
You get a hypo if your blood sugar gets too low .
This might happen : If you take too much insulin If you eat too little or miss a meal If you exercise more than usual .
Your blood sugar may get too high ( this is called hyperglycaemia ) .
They include : increased urination ; feeling thirsty ; losing your appetite ; feeling sick ( nausea or vomiting ) ; feeling drowsy or tired ; flushed , dry skin ; dry mouth and a fruity ( acetone ) smell of the breath .
If you get any of these signs , test your blood sugar level and test your urine for ketones if you can .
Then seek medical advice straight away .
These may be signs of a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .
If you don t treat it , this could lead to diabetic coma and death .
Having forgotten to take your insulin Repeatedly taking less insulin than you need An infection or a fever Eating more than usual Less exercise than usual .
Like all medicines , Actraphane can cause side effects , although not everybody gets them .
Actraphane may cause hypoglycaemia ( low blood sugar ) .
See the advice in 4 What to do in an emergency .
Side effects reported uncommonly ( in less than 1 patient in 100 )
Changes at the injection site ( Lipodystrophy ) .
If you inject yourself too often at the same site , fatty tissue under the skin at this site may shrink ( lipoatrophy ) or thicken ( lipohypertrophy ) .
